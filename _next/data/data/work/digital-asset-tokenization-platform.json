The metadata represents the rights and obligations of the token holder and issuer. It may also contain other terms and agreements pertaining to the use of the transferable assets encapsulated by the token.</p>\n<p>The metadata on each asset is stored in fixed byte positions within several ‘faux-keys’ in a P2SH multisig. So the private keys are split between holders and several signatures are required to initiate a transaction. As part of the token issuance process, the parameters are serialized and hashed, then the hash is cryptographically signed by the issuer.</p>\n<p>The token is transacted in the same way as regular BCH currency, so the validating nodes won’t necessarily know they are processing a token. It’s a great way of ensuring privacy and security.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Smart contracts for enforcing rights and obligations</h3>\n","text":"<p>Besides metadata, the Obito platform also allows embedding programmable logic into BCH transactions. It opens up the opportunity to create complex <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/smart-contract-development-audit/\">smart contracts</a> that would allow the disbursement of tokens only if certain conditions are met. Some agreements may even be encoded to be automatically executed. For example, a monthly subscription fee to a service can be regularly withdrawn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/obito-case-scheme.jpg\" alt=\"Programmable logic of Obito project\" width=\"850\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>It is also possible to link transaction outputs to external resources on a distributed database. This enables smart contracts to monitor certain events in the real world using IoT devices and trigger transactions if a pre-agreed task is completed.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts can also be used to declare requirements and conditions across various jurisdictions to ensure compliance with regulations. KYC/AML procedures are carried out within the platform itself.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Modular architecture enables scalability</h3>\n","text":"<p>The Obito tokenization platform follows a modular approach to design, with standalone components interconnected with APIs. This architecture allows diverse industry sectors to integrate their business models, creating a sophisticated ecosystem where players from different markets openly collaborate with each other.</p>\n<p>Participants on the platform can create their own smart contracts to define and execute business rules. The platform can stage Distributed Autonomous Organisations (DAO) with fully automated and streamlined processes where human supervision and intervention is minimal.</p>\n<p>With different types of businesses, including DAO enterprises and all the other pieces in place, the platform could potentially grow to become a fully decentralized crypto-economy with the robust Bitcoin blockchain at its core.</p>\n"}],"title":"Details"},{"acf_fc_layout":"call_to_action","title":"Got an idea?

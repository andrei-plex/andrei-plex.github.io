Its founder and CEO is Alexa Aguila Genoyer.</p>\n<p>Blue Karma Secrets is set to develop into a global brand, offering transformative luxury escapes on multiple continents. The resorts are currently undergoing expansion. From April 2019, the number of guest houses and other facilities on the premises is consistently increasing.</p>\n<p>The client came up with an idea to create a scalable solution that would allow to conduct Blue Karma Secrets equity sale and raise funds in a secure &amp; regulated manner with a <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/sto-platform/\">security token offering</a> (STO).</p>\n<p>To bring the solution to life, PixelPlex team was challenged to create a web representation of a security asset offering campaign, with real estate properties represented in the form of Ethereum tokens.</p>\n<p><b>Resorts STO</b> is a platform that supports the whole life-cycle of security token offering processes.

The Investment Calculator embedded into the page provides the prospective investor with information on the number of shares resulting from a particular sum of contributed USD. The dashboard displays a roadmap with details of the equity sale: land purchase, land access, permit acquisition, etc. Investors always have access to the information they need and can easily monitor their contributions and dividends.</p>\n<p>PixelPlex has made a few custom changes to the STO platform to comply with the Swiss legal system and successfully integrated the solution into an existing ecosystem of one of the largest Swiss banks.</p>\n"}],"title":"Details"},{"acf_fc_layout":"call_to_action","title":"Got an idea?

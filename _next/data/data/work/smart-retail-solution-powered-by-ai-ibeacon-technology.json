Irrelevant marketing messages are inefficient for people who want to see specific information on products they are looking for.</p>\n<p>Building and maintaining an effective retail business requires complete customer experience research, analysis, and optimization. That’s why PixelPlex decided to build a smart retail solution capable of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Obtaining insights into customer behavior &amp; preferences;</li>\n<li>Performing data analysis &amp; offering accurate projections;</li>\n<li>Providing customers with highly-targeted and customized promotions;</li>\n<li>Optimizing in-store processes;</li>\n<li>Building optimized marketing strategies;</li>\n<li>Influencing purchase decisions and boosting customer engagement.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"<h3>iBeacons</h3>\n","text":"<p>iBeacons are small wireless hardware devices that transmit data packets containing an ID with their spatial data and a component that indicates the status of the beacon via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals.

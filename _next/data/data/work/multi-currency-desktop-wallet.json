The functionality of local node support allows the possibility for users to take part in the consensus process of the network.</p>\n<p>The main currency of Blip is ECHO. However, all ERC20-compliant token types can easily be added to the wallet. Apart from showing total wallet balance in its core ECHO coin, Blip also indicates individual balance for each digital asset separately within a single UI.</p>\n<p>All user private keys are stored locally on desktop&#8217;s local storage directory. To implement this mechanism of key retention, we built an extra layer of encryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Approved by the US federal government, this cryptographic algorithm is widely used for encrypting top secret information.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Blip as feature-rich solution</h3>\n","text":"<p>Apart from wallet auto-lock, account import and recovery, Blip also offers multilingual support and automatic generation of a unique QR code. The QR code coupled with a corresponding link contains all payment parameters needed for a transaction, and both serve as a quick and easy way to send someone a request for payment.</p>\n<p>Transaction History feed page displays all recent wallet activity in full detail. Even for users who are new to Echo and its ecosystem, navigating through Blip will be a breeze.</p>\n<p>While combining usability with a high level of privacy and security, Blip makes a great desktop wallet option for everyday transactions or for holding cryptocurrency as an investment.</p>\n<p>* <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/smart-contract-layer-2-blockchain-protocol/\">Echo</a> is a <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/dapp-development/\">DApp development</a> platform and network powered by the integration of Bitcoin and smart contracts.

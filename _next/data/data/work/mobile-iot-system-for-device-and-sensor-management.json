Efficient business and asset management require both companies and individuals to search for a solution that can provide valuable, real-time insights into various processes. Maintaining a safe and comfortable environment in a large office, manufacture complex or a private residential unit is becoming increasingly vital, creating a strong need for a comprehensive process automation. However, proper control over sustainable use of resources and energy consumption often becomes neglected due to the number of running devices and systems, or overall complexity of operations.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Smart Device Control</h3>\n","text":"<p>The <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/mobile-app-development/\">mobile app delivered</a> by our team has been designed to meet the most demanding asset monitoring scenarios. <b>CTRL </b>puts the user in complete control over efficiency and consumption of power.</p>\n<p>Different types of sensors are the most popular use cases. As soon as a sensor understands that there’s no one in the room, the lights automatically turn off. If a temperature sensor shows a value that goes beyond predetermined permissible parameters, the intensity of energy decreases. There&#8217;s also an option to set up more complicated routines.</p>\n<p>The system can re-configure software and device settings intuitively and remotely, without the need to have physical access to the device. Besides, the user may also use <b>CTRL</b> for ordinary automatic actions like adjusting room temperature based on the time of day for minimizing evening- and night-time energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Through a smart device, from anywhere and at any time, the application ensures strong comprehensive control, which is exactly what <b>CTRL </b>stands for.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Solution Architecture</h3>\n","text":"<p>The solution works by interconnecting wireless devices and integrating the <b>CTRL </b>app across wireless automation protocols Z-Wave, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and BLE.

Foundation designs products that open up the world, creating tools that enable financial freedom and wealth generation for everyone.</p>\n<p>Their vision is to create a global environment for people

assets, and other promising industries.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Challenge</h3>\n","text":"<p>Among many issues that stand before the investment industry are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of easy-to-use platforms for investors and start-up projects that support a <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/ui-ux-design/\">comprehensive UI with advanced UX</a>, while still retaining the advantages of blockchain (public trust and decentralization);</li>\n<li>Human involvement makes it impossible to aggregate and distribute investment assets in real time;</li>\n<li>Lawyers, escrow agents, and brokers are required to establish trust before executing transactions, which is inefficient, insecure, and expensive;</li>\n<li>Maintaining ledgers, processing transactions, sending and receiving capital, managing investments, redemptions and liquidations without a decentralized platform also leads to high expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Smart Contracts</h3>\n","text":"<p>We worked on the development of core smart contract functionality using <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/ethereum-development/\">Ethereum</a>. Smart contracts allow automating the functionality of hedge funds to enable direct investments without the need of going through brokers. In addition, this creates a fair investment ecosystem for everyone, and pushes more profits back to investors, eliminating additional expenses when an intermediary fund or broker facilitates transactions for a high fee.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>ICO Web Portal</h3>\n","text":"<p>PixelPlex team has designed and developed a modern ICO website with user profile, generation of unique account addresses and ability to participate in ICO via various currency (BTC, ETH, DASH, Monero, Ether classic), viewing ICO transaction history, live campaign status updates, and token withdrawal after ICO completion.</p>\n<p>Our work resulted in a successful initial token distribution, which led to MyBIT community conducting a second, 2019 campaign to further develop their platform and enable user acquisition, scalability, and full decentralization of MyBit project. Their goals were to transition to a fully decentralized governance structure, becoming one of the first self-governing co-operative tech projects on the web.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>MyBIT Software Development Kit</h3>\n","text":"<p>PixelPlex also took part in the development of MyBIT SDK.

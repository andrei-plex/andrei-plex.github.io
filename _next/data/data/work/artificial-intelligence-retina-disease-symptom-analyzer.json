The problem is that there is no universal database on the various pathologies of the human retina. This causes difficulty for inexperienced medical staff to provide an accurate diagnosis. As a result, many pathologies are not given care to on the early stages, and the disease develops to a more critical phase.</p>\n"},{"title":"<h3>Data Inputs</h3>\n","text":"<p>We have been provided with a large array of data containing images of the fundus and masks for disease symptoms and structures of the human eye.

The main concept of U-Net is to expand the usual contracting network by adding successive layers, each with a multi-channel feature map. Pooling operations are replaced by upsampling operators. Each downsampling step doubles the number of feature channels.</p>\n<p>These layers increase the resolution of the output. High-resolution features from the contracting path are combined with the upsampled output.</p>\n<p>The overlap-tile strategy is used for segmentation of large images where missing data is extrapolated by mirroring.</p>\n<p>Overall, the implementation of this architecture model allowed us to use fewer training images and yield more precise segmentations than any other model.

It will also provide assistance in monitoring the progression of the disease, which is often evaluated by highly-qualified medical personnel.</p>\n<p>AIRA will be able to spot symptoms of disease with such high precision which a regular physician could not accomplish, and also create mathematical models later to be used to enhance the neural network analysis process even more.</p>\n"}],"title":"Details"},{"acf_fc_layout":"call_to_action","title":"Got an idea?

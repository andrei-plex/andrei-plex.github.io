So if you are still relying on a brick-and-mortar strategy with a single-channel online presence, you need to strongly consider digital transformation in retail for your business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"digital-transformation-in-retail\">What Is Digital Transformation in Retail?</h2>\n<p>Digital retail transformation means a revolutionary change of your traditional business processes by utilizing modern technologies, incorporating multiple engagement channels, and adopting a customer-centric approach. It leads you to create a whole new and efficient business model when your physical and digital points of sale form a cohesive omnichannel environment in combination with multi-channel digital retail marketing and promotion mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The primary components of an <b>omnichannel digital retail solution</b> are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Physical stores</b>. Despite the fact that everything is going digital, brick-and-mortar retail locations remain one of the key channels as <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252465926/Almost-half-of-shoppers-still-prefer-brands-with-stores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">46% of shoppers</a> still prefer brands that have a physical store to visit.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Mobile-first website</b>. As mobile traffic continues to grow, it is predicted that over <a href=\"https://www.warc.com/content/paywall/article/warc-datapoints/almost_three_quarters_of_internet_users_will_be_mobileonly_by_2025/124845\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">70% of users</a> (3.7 billion) worldwide will access the web from their smartphones by 2025. Having a website that can be easily navigated from a mobile device carries paramount importance.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Two-way customer communication</b>. A customer-centric approach requires showing your customers that you care. For instance, you can enable online customer support, live chat, and product reviews. Ratingthe reviews and pointing customers to the ones that are most helpful builds customer trust.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Native mobile apps for in-store activities</b>. True engagement does not cease the moment when the customer walks into the store. Major retail outlets already have mobile apps that shoppers use while navigating shelves in search of goods, providing them with special offers and discounts along the way.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Product customization tools</b>. Major brands such as Levi’s and Nike offer  personalized shopping experiences with products that can be tuned to the customers’ preferences and lifestyles. Having these tools in place will significantly increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Multiple payment channels</b>. Offering multiple payment options to your customers (Google Pay, Paypal, Apple Pay, WePay, etc.) is one of the cornerstones of digital transformation in retail. If you are only relying on credit card payments, it will drastically reduce your chances of selling while increasing your bounce and cart abandonment rates.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>CMS with analytics and customer segmentation</b>. Today the brand that knows most about their customers is the one that outruns the competition. Encourage your shoppers to share their interests. <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/ai-smart-shopping-mobile-app/\">Gather this information</a>, pinpoint your most profitable customer groups and deliver the experience that meets their everyday needs.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Social media marketing</b>. With <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/online-shopping-statistics/#5-essential-online-shopping-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">43% of global buyers</a> searching for products online via social media and shoppable, social profiles have been getting a lot of traction over the past year. Now is the right time for retailers to capitalize upon and take advantage of this new revenue-generating channel.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Email marketing</b>. Emails are still a very good way of sharing offers, recommendations and countering cart abandonment. Personalization is the future of email marketing and is very effective when using the right tools to track your customers’ shopping habits.</li>\n<li><b>Google My Business and Google Shopping</b>. Many consumers use Google Shopping to browse, compare and make purchases from different brands without the need to visit the retailer’s website. Making yourself discoverable via Google My Business and Google Shopping will definitely generate more sales for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"time-for-transformation\">Why Now Is the Right Time for Digital Transformation in Retail</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://backend.pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/why-now-is-the-right-time-for-digital-transformation-in-retail.jpg\" alt=\"A person holds a phone that shows payments details\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" /></p>\n<p>We are way past the late 90s. Online shopping has become  ‘just shopping’ and not something that people turned to once in a while. The lines between in-store and digital shopping have been blurred with proliferation of the emerging technologies. Consequently, retailers have no other choice than to create an omnichannel cohesive buying experience both online and offline.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses need to reassure consumers and restore their confidence by meeting their new buying patterns. This includes setting up a shopping ecosystem of interconnected services and eCommerce funnels and at the same time making sure to have a robust online infrastructure, strong enough to withstand a large influx of online customers.</p>\n<p>Store owners face serious barriers down the road to digital transformation in retail. Most of the problems are technological, including integration with legacy software and using APIs, migrating to modern platforms and merging databases. Turning to a software development company such as PixelPlex, that has enough experience working with modern tools and technologies used in digital retail is the best option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools-and-technologies\">Tools and Technologies for Digital Transformation in Retail</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://backend.pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tools-and-technologies-for-digital-transformation-in-retail.jpg\" alt=\"A table with laptop, glasses, notebook and pen\" width=\"650\" height=\"433\" /></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/best-ecommerce-cms-for-your-business/\">responsive website</a>, along with mobile apps to accompany customers through their whole shopping route to provide a personalized experience are the basics in digital retail.

The hospitality industry is currently one of the most competitive markets, which is why businesses regularly search for new ways to improve their customer service and attract more clients to their business.</p>\n<p>At present, concierge apps are a relatively new advancement in the hospitality industry. Judging by the stats, the concierge service market is growing very quickly. According to <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/concierge-services-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grand View Research</a>, the market size of global concierge services was valued at $537,6M in 2018 and is expected to reach a CAGR of 5,3% from 2019 to 2025.</p>\n<p>But what exactly are concierge apps and what are their benefits? More importantly, what does it take to build a digital concierge service? Read on to find answers to these and many other questions on concierge apps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-concierge-app\">What is a concierge app?</h2>\n<p>A concierge app is a mobile app that allows users to request different types of concierge services to enhance their comfort. Commonly used in the hospitality industry (hotels, resorts, restaurants, and travel agencies), mobile concierge apps can be viewed as a traveler’s personal assistant that can help them quickly book lodging or a table in a restaurant, orchestrate hotel registration, or organize an excursion.</p>\n<p>As for businesses, mobile concierge apps help significantly improve their service offering by delivering their services faster and more efficiently. For example, hotels can develop digital concierge solutions to streamline the registration process and provide travelers with real-time data on hotel facilities. Travel agencies for their part can build concierge service apps to assist travelers with tour selection and organization, and much more.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Low-code vs no-code app development platform: which one should you choose?","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/low-code-vs-no-code-app-development/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>How do concierge apps work?</h3>\n<p>Concierge apps are responsible for providing relevant information to users and helping them organize any activity they want. For example, a concierge app can build a comprehensive itinerary for a traveler or simply provide answers to their questions.</p>\n<p>Most commonly, a concierge app will follow a four-step process:</p>\n<p># 1 A client request like ordering a room or booking a table</p>\n<p># 2 Request processing and resolution, e.g. checking the availability of a specific room and then booking it</p>\n<p># 3 Feedback request from the client to understand areas for improvement</p>\n<p># 4 Results analysis and improvements based on client feedback and suggestions</p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-concierge-apps\">What are the main types of concierge app?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/what-are-the-main-types-of-concierge-apps.jpg\" alt=\"Types of concierge apps, including front-desk concierge apps, travel concierge apps, and conference management apps\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Although the main purpose of any mobile concierge service is to assist users with their requests, <strong>concierge apps can be classified into three main categories</strong>: front desk, travel, and conference management.</p>\n<p><strong>Front-desk concierge apps</strong> are the actual digital concierge services that allow users to check in and check out, order room service, book tables, and use other services available in a hotel (SPA, excursions, and entertainments). These applications are like a replica of a human operating at the front desk of a hotel and they allow users to order a service in just a few clicks.</p>\n<p><strong>Travel concierge apps</strong> are aimed at enhancing travelers’ experiences by allowing users to book flights, get recommendations on nearby restaurants, order sightseeing tours and entertainment, and provide relevant information on city sights.</p>\n<p><strong>Conference management apps</strong> are focused on simplifying conference and event management. They are used by event organizers to send conference agendas to their participants, issue reminders about upcoming conferences, handle catering services, and much more.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check out ProCoffee — a convenient concierge service that allows users to order coffee online and take it away without waiting in a queue","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/mobile-solution-for-ordering-coffee-online/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"concierge-app-benefits\">What are the benefits of a concierge app?</h2>\n<p>To understand whether or not it is worth using a mobile concierge app, let’s check out what benefits they can offer.</p>\n<h3>Cost-efficiency</h3>\n<p>Let’s be honest: practically any business regularly searches for new tools and methods to reduce their costs while still offering an effective service. With concierge apps, there’s no need to hire and train employees to handle those concierge requests and reply to client queries. This way businesses can significantly reduce the costs of staff hiring and training.</p>\n<h3>Access to client data</h3>\n<p>A concierge application is a great tool to understand your clients’ needs and preferences. With the large amount of data collected by a digital concierge service, you can make more informed decisions and offer personalized experiences to your clients, being able to predict their needs and requests.</p>\n<h3>Client loyalty and increased engagement</h3>\n<p>Digital concierge services minimize waiting time and allow users to instantly find relevant information and answers to their questions. By delivering an efficient and hassle-free service, you will be able to build trust and loyalty among your clients. This way, a concierge app becomes a powerful tool to communicate your brand and increase customer engagement.</p>\n<h3>New revenue streams</h3>\n<p>Users generally prefer a single <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/how-to-create-mobile-apps/\">mobile app</a> rather than multiple apps for different purposes. And a concierge app can become an all-in-one solution where users can find any service they need. Therefore, you can consider collaborating with third-party vendors (on-demand delivery services, taxi services, etc.), which would allow you not only to attract a larger audience but also benefit from new revenue sources.</p>\n<h3>Internal staff efficiency</h3>\n<p>By collecting and processing service requests, a mobile concierge service frees your employees from routine and time-consuming activities and allows them to focus on other essential aspects of customer service. Moreover, with direct access to client feedback, you can evaluate staff efficiency and optimize your internal processes.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Planning to build a cross-platform mobile app catering to multiple devices?

Your goal is to identify and prioritize these features.</p>\n<p>Generally, your feature list will be divided into key features (e.g. the ability to request a service) that would go into the MVP release, and advanced features — the so-called nice-to-have features (e.g. automated check-ins and check-outs) that usually go into subsequent releases.</p>\n<h4>What are the must-have features for a concierge app?</h4>\n<p>A good concierge app should provide the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Registration and login</strong> to be able to use the app services</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>In-app search</strong>, enabling users to quickly find relevant information</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Booking</strong> different services, from a room in a hotel to other services like meals, parking, etc. Ideally there should be different filters to simplify the booking process</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Payment method</strong>, enabling users to instantly pay for the ordered services. Your concierge app should have several payment methods and meet all security protocols and data regulations</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Direct chat or chatbots</strong>, enabling users to stay in touch with your organization anytime and instantly receive assistance</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Admin panel</strong>, allowing you to track data, check out reservations, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the advanced features, these may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Integrations with third-party services</strong>, which would allow you to enhance your existing service offering.

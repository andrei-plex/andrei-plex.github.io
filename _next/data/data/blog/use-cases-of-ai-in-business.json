As a characteristic of the software and physical agents, artificial intelligence gives them the ability to take action, react, and understand language, and outperform humans in singular tasks. Artificially intelligent agents are dynamic as they utilize the contextual data to learn and adapt to new situations.</p>\n<p>We all have already experienced the impact of AI on our everyday lives by using Google&#8217;s predictive search, learning about the weather from Siri, or having Alexa play our favorite music. However, these examples are only scratching the surface of opportunities brought by AI solutions for business.</p>\n<p>AI application in the business context saves time in performing routine administrative tasks, as well as provides tools and new ways to increase customer satisfaction and broaden the customer base. Embracing AI for business is cost-effective, integral to customer engagement, and convenient for mitigating the lack of skilled personnel in an organization.</p>\n<p>Read on to learn about the current state of AI in business, the reasons why entrepreneurs should use the technology, its benefits, the top companies that apply it to solve their challenges, and how to adopt it for your business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outlook-on-ai\">Outlook on artificial intelligence</h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is the synergy of a range of tools and technologies that are equipped for sensing, understanding data, extracting insights, and performing tasks based on the knowledge obtained. With the ability to learn from data and adapt over time, it is seen as one of the most efficient solutions for automating business processes and making autonomous decisions.</p>\n<p>The accumulation of large amounts of data gathered from users through social media, eCommerce, educational and other platforms, and a deeper understanding of how to use this data created strong demand for smart AI systems. Machine learning, knowledge-based systems, and natural language processing are some of its top implementations today.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge-based systems</h3>\n<p>Knowledge-based systems or expert systems are some of the most adopted and probably the most successful AI systems for business. As a subset of knowledge-based systems, rule-based systems make use of the set of rules previously modeled by experts to provide support in making difficult business decisions. These systems have the proficiency of human experts. Newer versions of expert systems also include probabilistic relations, such as between cause and effect, augmented by causality and temporal relationships as well.</p>\n<h3>Natural language processing</h3>\n<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is an essential AI technology for business operations today. In its simplest form, these systems offer reliable translation in a defined context. Business applications of NLP are many, from solutions for internal collaboration to database searches, from content management to online customer support to e-Commerce.</p>\n<p>Most adopted business applications of NLP include content and link analysis of web pages, extraction of specific information from texts, and automated classification. Natural language processing uses machine learning techniques to convert unstructured data from text, audio, and video sources to structured data that can be utilized by decision-makers.</p>\n<h3>Machine learning</h3>\n<p>Machine learning is a collection of computational algorithms that can process large amounts of data quickly and &#8220;make sense&#8221; of that data. This technology leverages learning as a dynamic process, and the algorithms have the capability of getting better at what they do, the more often they do it. One of the most remarkable machine learning techniques is deep learning. Deep learning is the integration of several neural networks capable of learning from unstructured data. Deep learning algorithms have become very efficient and accurate due to the large scale availability of business data and the increase in available computing power.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is disrupting existing business models and creating new ones in many industries. According to PwC’s research AI will have a <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">US$15.7 Trillion potential contribution</a> to the global economy by 2030 and up to 26% boost in GDP for the local economies. The key advantages of AI are scalability and continuous improvement capabilities. In terms of business, these advantages will increase corporate productivity, lower the costs, reduce human error, and create an expanding and competitive advantage for enterprises.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check this smart grocery shopping list running on machine learning technology","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/ai-smart-shopping-mobile-app/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"reasons-why-business-entrepreneurs-should-use-ai\">Reasons why business entrepreneurs should use AI</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/reasons-why-business-entrepreneurs-should-use-ai.jpg\" alt=\"Two people next to a chart and clocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Businesses can utilize AI technology to achieve strategic objectives in figuring out what was wrong with their strategies in the past, making predictions about what will happen in the future, and setting plans on how to achieve better results. In light of these objectives, there are five reasons why business entrepreneurs should use AI.</p>\n<h3>Access to information</h3>\n<p>AI solutions streamline the processes of identification, retrieval, and utilization of information across the entire enterprise. Timely access to the right information is significant for making informed and collaborative decisions that influence business outcomes.</p>\n<h3>Generating insights</h3>\n<p>AI-based business tools can uncover hidden insights in data. Insights are essential for a thorough understanding of cause and effect relations within a business context. Having access to the most valuable insights helps business entrepreneurs make better decisions that enable profitable and sustainable growth.</p>\n<h3>Corporate foresight</h3>\n<p>AI can help enterprises leverage data from the past to predict future outcomes. Corporate foresight capability can anticipate the changes early on, suggest the best course of action to meet business requirements, and ensure long-term survival and success of the company.</p>\n<h3>Business agility</h3>\n<p>Utilizing AI can help businesses increase their ability to rapidly adapt to the changing market and environmental conditions while maintaining productivity and keeping the expenses to a minimum. Recently, organizations around the world started using cloud computing, business-IT alignment, enterprise architectures, and context modeling to increase their business agility. Artificial intelligence acts as the binding material for these approaches while accelerating the organization’s real-time decision making.</p>\n<h3>Strategic alignment</h3>\n<p>AI serves as the connecting mechanism in business – from strategy to execution. Data-driven AI alignment encourages the establishment of business strategies for amping up the performance benchmark of its processes. At the same time, AI can increase enterprise and operational visibility and relate them to preferences, priorities, aims, and needs in a business context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-AI-for-business\">Benefits of AI for business</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/benefits-of-ai-for-business.jpg\" alt=\"A happy person holding the AI logo in hands next to an aim hit by an arrow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence in business encompasses a set of computational tools and techniques that enables organizations to gain actionable insights from data, which, in return, increases efficiency, reduces costs, boosts revenue streams, and helps achieve corporate, social, and economic goals.</p>\n<h3>Increased efficiency</h3>\n<p>Machines and tools powered by artificial intelligence can outperform people in certain tasks, work around the clock, never sleep, don&#8217;t take breaks, and don&#8217;t have issues with focusing. They can support your business 24/7 and respond to significant events just at the right moment or answer customers’ requests.</p>\n<p>One of the main advantages of AI is its ability to analyze large datasets very quickly as compared to long hours or days it would take a team of human experts to accomplish. Artificial intelligence can also perform repetitive tasks and automate work routines which is particularly useful for small business owners.</p>\n<h3>Competitive advantage</h3>\n<p>Data is the new fuel that needs to be processed to make it valuable for the modern digital economy. Enterprises can use AI to instantly crunch vast amounts of data and get better answers to questions relevant to their domains. For instance, a digital content company might need insight into what movies their customers prefer and make accurate predictions on whether customers might cancel the subscription. Retailers may want to know which items sell best at different periods of time throughout the year. Artificial intelligence can provide these forecasts with relatively high accuracy based on historical and contextual data.</p>\n<p>Insights mean a competitive advantage for businesses, enabling companies to create better products and services for their customers, reduce the risk of failures, reduce costs, increase operational efficiency, and improve safety and compliance.</p>\n<h3>Mitigating errors</h3>\n<p>AI performs as accurately as possible based on the available data. It is not prone to mistakes attributive to human opinions or emotions. However, AI sometimes may form biased decisions if the dataset does not accurately represent the entire population or a variety of cases. For example, Amazon once scrapped a gender-biased AI recruiter tool that picked mostly male applicants from a pool of CVs submitted over several years. The problem was that the CVs in the dataset came predominantly from men.</p>\n<h3>Improved customer experience</h3>\n<p>AI solutions for improving customer experience involves using their behavior data to provide products or services that are more appealing to them. For example, the <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence-in-marketing/\">marketing department</a> can predict how select customer groups may react to their marketing message. By evaluating how customers talk to each other, an AI chatbot can recommend phrases and moods that are the best fit with a segment of the audience. The data about customers, their location, favorite products, and social activity can help businesses offer more relevant products and customized experiences.</p>\n<p>One of the best use cases of AI used for enhanced customer experience is Netflix&#8217;s recommendation engine that is personalized and suggests movies based on individual preference. Similarly, Spotify uses AI to create playlists according to the user’s preferences. Amazon&#8217;s Alexa assistant helps prepare shopping lists, create music playlists, send emails, and find basic information. In the travel industry, off-the-shelf AI solutions are available to customers 24/7 in real-time to suggest personalized vacation packages and give updated information about their scheduled itineraries.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced security</h3>\n<p>Data security is a burning topic with hacking and security breaches happening on an annoyingly regular basis. When monitoring is being done by people there is always a chance of human factor.</p>\n<p>In its turn, AI is a great tool to prevent data leakage and detect fraud attempts as it can keep track of immense amounts of data and single out suspicious activities. AI can also incorporate such instruments as machine learning and speech recognition to prevent security violation acts.</p>\n<p>According to Statista, the global cybersecurity market size is going to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/595182/worldwide-security-as-a-service-market-size/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$345 billion</a> by 2026 which proves that businesses consider AI to be of great use when protecting sensitive data.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Want to know more about the impact of AI on cybersecurity?

AI software allows developers to identify issues early on and can suggest a course of action to maintain uptime of their IT systems.</p>\n<h3>Human resources</h3>\n<p>Even though human resources deal exclusively with humans, artificial intelligence has made a significant mark in this field. Modern recruitment processes are unimaginable without the involvement of AI. Besides automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, AI can conduct interviews, classify candidates according to their skills and build large competence pools. These tools help human resource professionals make data-based decisions based on their internal processes.</p>\n<h3>Accounting and finance</h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is transforming the accounting and finance professions by simplifying and automating most mundane tasks, making data more accurate, and accelerating processes. Advanced AI solutions are able to streamline invoice management, validate clients by checking their credit histories and tax information, and eliminate paper-based processes and workflows that involve dealing with multiple incompatible digital systems. Smart applications can extract data from various sources, consolidate it, and generate reports. Some AI systems can even ensure compliance with internal and external policies. Chatbots can be used to answer frequent questions from customers, including checking their account balances, their account status, due dates for bills, and more.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Learn more about the ways AI is improving the banking systems","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-banking/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"how-to-adopt-ai-into-your-business\">How to adopt AI into your business</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/how-to-adopt-AI-into-your-business.jpg\" alt=\"An AI-supported android helping a businessman go up the success ladder\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has the remarkable potential to reshape business in every sector of the global economy. That’s why entrepreneurs need to act now to capitalize on new opportunities. Some companies, however, are utilizing the &#8220;wait and see&#8221; strategy, which is proving to be very passive with the surge of new players in the market. While some AI applications have an immediate impact on business, others have a snowball effect that is harder to visualize.</p>\n<p>In the current state of Al development, companies need to make urgent but clear-headed decisions and quickly react to the possibilities and risks that go hand-in-hand with digital transformation. While there is no definitive recipe, the five elements below are key for attempting AI integration.</p>\n<h3>Identify the right business use cases</h3>\n<p>The most basic and important step in adopting AI into an organization is to identify the business use case that has the highest value potential and to align it with the company&#8217;s strategy. This step requires the identification of realistic capabilities, accounting for the limitations that AI has in a specific real-world scenario. Identifying the right business use case is a knowledge-intensive element of AI transformation because it requires expertise in both business development and the inner workings of AI technology.</p>\n<p>In the short-term, it is advisable to develop use cases that have proven scalable AI technology solutions such as robotic process automation or specific applications of machine learning. For the medium-term, companies can choose use cases utilizing emerging AI technologies that haven&#8217;t been proven scalable yet. For the long-term, companies can choose use cases with unproven AI technologies that will have high impact and partner with researchers or third-party companies that specialize in the development of AI solutions.</p>\n<h3>Build up your data ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Data is a critical business asset for companies that want to join the AI revolution. AI algorithms require large volumes of data for training that often come from multiple different systems and sources in various formats. Companies should identify the sources of their data, build infrastructure for its storage and processing, anticipate the expenses associated with the collection, embrace the risks of erroneous data, and develop strategies for obtaining additional data relevant to its business operations.</p>\n<p>The real benefits of data ecosystems become evident when companies diversify the types of data they collect and store. Usually, one type of data can become useful only when combined and analyzed together with the others. For example, the combination of customer sentiment with real-time event geo-data can give business exclusivity and unprecedented customer experience to any brand.</p>\n<h3>Develop your AI capabilities</h3>\n<p>The internal capabilities to develop the desired AI solution is the cornerstone of a successful transformation. Only organizations with the right know-how will be able to capture the real value of artificial intelligence. Companies need to foster expert developers to design, implement, deploy, troubleshoot, maintain, and advance their AI initiatives.</p>\n<p>In order to develop the full range of capabilities, companies may need to partner with external solution providers that have specific expertise or delegate some of their key operations to other service providers. An agile development approach is essential for companies to move faster through the test and learn cycles.</p>\n<h3>Integrate AI into your business workflow</h3>\n<p>Running AI solutions at scale and getting satisfactory results is only a small part of the story. To completely capture the benefits of the use case, companies must redesign business processes and integrate the results into their workflows. Sometimes integration may involve automation, and other times it requires designing channels so that the right data insights reach the right people within the company.</p>\n<p>The integration of AI insights into the business workflows requires re-thinking and resetting of human-machine interfaces. A clear distinction is needed to divide tasks between company staff and machines. In an AI-driven world, many job descriptions will need to be revised and updated.</p>\n<h3>Train your workforce</h3>\n<p>Adopting artificial intelligence into the business process requires long-term organizational changes. The paradigm of human-machine collaboration is relatively new, and the workforce needs to be apprised and adopted to this mindset. Businesses must provide education about opportunities and challenges of this paradigm to foster new types of collaboration.</p>\n<p>Training the workforce may take time, so creating an AI-ready company culture should come early on in the transformation. Special attention should be dedicated to the education of mid-level managers on how to use data-driven insights in their decision-making process.</p>\n<p>In an AI-driven business, employees must be retrained to work alongside automated agents. At the same time, some of the developers will need to acquire special skills to support AI-based operations. Throughout these changes, it is important to maintain strong leadership and have a clear organizational vision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-10-most-innovative-ai-companies-improving-business-processes\">Top 10 most innovative AI companies improving business processes</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/top-10-most-innovative-AI-companies-improving-business-processes.jpg\" alt=\"A person in a business suit on the background of a chart and AI icon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM are the leading companies that provide solutions through their cloud platforms and enable other companies to <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/future-ai-applications-benefits-impact-on-business/\">develop AI applications</a> without the expense of having an in-house team.

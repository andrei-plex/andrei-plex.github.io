On top of this, Collins Dictionary chose the term NFT as its 2021 <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/11/24/collins-dictionary-nft-2021-word-year/8754569002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">word of the year</a>, giving it priority over other digital-revolution and pandemic-driven words such as crypto, metaverse, hybrid working, etc.</p>\n<p>But it is not just NFTs that are stealing the show.

According to some stats, that year saw total spending of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/nft-market-surpassed-40-billion-in-2021-new-estimate-shows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">$41 billion</a> worth of crypto on NFT marketplace development.</p>\n<h3>So what is an NFT marketplace really?</h3>\n<p>Simply put, an NFT marketplace is a platform that allows users to store, showcase, trade, and even create (mint) non-fungible tokens. These platforms generally make use of blockchain technology in order to verify the provenance and authenticity of the digital assets represented on the NFT marketplace website.</p>\n<p>The best thing about NFT platforms is that they allow for effective cooperation and interaction between buyers and sellers. Once a transaction has been successfully carried out, a buyer/investor receives a token — a unique identifier representing proof of ownership and containing data about its origin, transaction history, author, and authenticity.</p>\n<p>As of now, it is possible to either obtain or put up for sale a wide variety of digital assets, including works of art, in-game assets, memes, video clips, virtual land plots, and so on. The range of opportunities is wide and diverse and it is likely that we will see much more in the future.</p>\n<h3>What types of NFT marketplace are out there?</h3>\n<p>All NFT platforms fall into one of two key categories, augmented or streamlined.</p>\n<p><strong>Streamlined NFT marketplaces</strong> provide support to a broad range of NFTs and offer merchants more limited, generic services. Essentially, this type of NFT platform gives users the freedom to opt for the most convenient means of payment — either fiat or crypto.</p>\n<p>Streamlined NFT platforms are often compared to traditional eCommerce platforms like eBay and Amazon and they make it possible to hold both auctions and fixed-price sales for various non-fungible tokens. The most vivid examples of streamlined marketplaces include OpenSea and Rarible.</p>\n<p><strong>Augmented NFT platforms</strong>, on the other hand, cater to the needs and requirements of specific, narrower niches, meaning that they zero in on offering specialized services to a particular category of non-fungible tokens. They are considered exclusive and usually charge higher fees on transactions compared to streamlined NFT marketplaces.</p>\n<p>NBA Top Shot and SuperRare are key examples of augmented platforms. NBA Top Shot focuses on unique basketball collectibles while SuperRare specializes in virtual works of art and offers all-encompassing organization and recommendation services.</p>\n<p>Before venturing into NFT marketplace development, you should carefully analyze the intricacies of both streamlined and augmented categories and determine which option will best fit your needs and expectations.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Looking for a professional NFT development partner?

These terms are pre-programmed in a self-executing digital contract stored on the blockchain network. The transaction is considered to be valid only after those terms have been met.</p>\n<p>On top of this, thanks to smart contracts it is possible to view all relevant data about an NFT, helping to inform the buyer about its provenance and trading history.</p>\n<p>To operate on an NFT marketplace, users will be required to <strong>connect their crypto wallets</strong>. These digital applications store data about the location of owners’ files on the blockchain. A crypto wallet also performs other functions such as allowing users to store, send, and receive digital assets.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that a crypto wallet should be compatible with the blockchain that the NFT platform is based on and support its functionality. These days, you can either choose from a variety of existing crypto wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet or <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/cryptocurrency-mobile-wallet-for-android-and-ios/\">create your own</a> from scratch which will be customized to your NFT platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-an-nft-marketplace-work\">And how does an NFT marketplace work?</h2>\n<p>Despite the fact that there are multiple NFT marketplace websites out there, each of them has its own unique algorithm and sequence of steps that empower users to create and sell NFTs.

Brands around the globe are chasing after NFTs, trying to stay on the same page as their customers and, of course, promote their products. Gucci, Coca-Cola, Asics, McDonald&#8217;s, and Ray-Ban are just a few of them.</p>\n<p>As well as this, in January 2022 OpenSea — the largest NFT marketplace — reported that its value reached <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59880739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$13 billion</a> after a recent surge in its user base. Given these pretty amazing metrics, it is wise to start thinking about the creation of your own NFT platform and be ready to launch it.</p>\n<p>You might argue that there are already enough NFT marketplaces that can cater to the interests and likes of various audiences. But they all have certain limitations and none of them can satisfy the needs of all users. On top of this, the majority of existing NFT marketplaces are like a crazy quilt, meaning that they specialize in providing generic services to the most popular NFT classes and prefer not to focus on exclusive NFT categories. So you can make a difference: there’s an opportunity to carve out a unique niche for yourself in this landscape, and create your own trailblazing NFT platform.</p>\n<p>But what benefits will you and/or your business gain from it?</p>\n<p>Well, first of all, apart from granting you a unique and highly feasible investment opportunity, your NFT platform — provided that it will skyrocket and gain wide traction — will help you <strong>establish a global presence, become a real game-changer</strong> in the entire NFT space, and <strong>diversify your business</strong>.</p>\n<p>Importantly, one of the reasons why NFT marketplace development has gained such wide prominence is that these platforms can actually <strong>bring profit to their owners</strong>. NFT marketplaces charge fees and commission either on purchasing or selling NFTs. Consequently, NFT marketplace owners always ride high and can make use of these unique revenue streams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-features-an-nft-marketplace-should-possess\">Understanding what features an NFT marketplace should possess</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/understanding-what-features-an-NFT-marketplace-should-possess.png\" alt=\"NFT marketplace with different NFTs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know how an NFT marketplace works and what makes it special, it is time to get to know more about the core features that an NFT platform should possess. In actual fact, you are free to define exactly what functionality and properties your marketplace-to-be will have.</p>\n<p>If you fear making a mistake and missing out on some essential features, it is certainly better to reach out to an experienced <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/it-consulting/\">consulting team</a> that will assist you in making the right decision. They will analyze your needs and requirements and come up with the most appropriate set of technical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Still and all, there are some universal features that any NFT platform is required to have in order to provide its users with positive experiences. They include a storefront, search bar, listings, bidding functionality, reviews and ratings, push notifications, and support.</p>\n<p>Let’s consider each of them in detail.</p>\n<h3>Catchy and attractive storefront</h3>\n<p>Normally, the job of a marketplace storefront is to feature relevant information about NFTs that are listed on the platform. This includes owner name(s), previews, value history, bids, and a myriad of other details.</p>\n<h3>Convenient search bar</h3>\n<p>A user should be able to quickly and effortlessly find the desired NFTs along with their data. Therefore, it is important to plan the development of an elaborate search bar that will help categorize and sort NFTs by different parameters such as images, videos, works of art, etc.</p>\n<h3>Ability to create listings</h3>\n<p>Users need to be able to mint their works and list them directly on the NFT platform. With this feature, customers should be able to effortlessly upload their digital assets as well as fill in necessary information such as product description, tags, title, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Bidding option</h3>\n<p>An NFT platform should ideally provide buying and auction functionality that will empower users to both obtain digital items and bid on them. By holding online auctions on an NFT marketplace, digital artists have a chance of getting the highest price for their works.</p>\n<p>Buyers, for their part, should be able to view current data and statistics on their bids in order to determine whether to purchase a certain artwork or place a new bid.</p>\n<h3>NFT ratings and reviews</h3>\n<p>By developing rating tools, buyers can objectively estimate a digital item and decide whether it is worth purchasing or not. What’s more, by viewing feedback and reviews about a particular platform participant, users can see how credible this trader is and whether they will be a reliable partner in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Push notifications</h3>\n<p>By implementing push notifications, you will allow users of your NFT marketplace to keep abreast of the latest NFT collection bids, NFT status changes, price updates, and new arrivals on the market.</p>\n<h3>Continuous support</h3>\n<p>The support service is an integral part of the platform. The support team needs to help users instantaneously eliminate any arising issues and help find answers to their questions.</p>\n<p>You can include a FAQ section on your NFT marketplace website as well as a <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/chatbot-development/\">chatbot</a> or email support service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-secure-an-nft-marketplace\">How to secure an NFT marketplace</h2>\n<p>Ensuring top security is one of the primary elements of NFT marketplace development. Given that your platform will be responsible for storing users’ private keys alongside their digital assets, you should be able to guarantee adequate and effective protection from any malicious activities and threats.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no marketplace is completely immune to hacks and frauds. For instance, OpenSea recently suffered a massive attack with the exploiter <a href=\"https://forkast.news/headlines/opensea-nft-marketplace-hacked-332-eth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">withdrawing $800,000</a> worth of crypto, and there are many other similar cases.</p>\n<p>By implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) alongside other cybersecurity techniques on your marketplace platform, you will mitigate the risk of fraud and forgery. You could employ other security techniques like DDoS and SSL striping to improve the overall security of your NFT platform.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Forewarned is forearmed: find out about NFT marketplace vulnerabilities and security concerns and learn how to prevent them","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/nft-marketplace-security/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"how-to-develop-an-nft-marketplace\">Discovering how to develop an NFT marketplace</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/discovering-how-to-develop-an-nft-marketplace.png\" alt=\"5 steps necessary to build an NFT marketplace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered all the elements of an NFT platform in detail, it is time to delve into the specifics of the development process and find out what steps it consists of. Below, we will describe the key stages and provide greater insight into each of them.</p>\n<h3>Step one — execute ideation and market research</h3>\n<p>Before creating an NFT marketplace, you must specify your target audience. To do this, you will need to decide which segment your NFT platform will cater to — music, video clips, works of art, sports collectibles and memorabilia, and so on.</p>\n<p>Remember that your platform should stand out among others and be of particular interest to the specific audience who will use it to trade. If you find it a bit challenging to conceptualize your NFT marketplace, turn to a professional team who will help you make the best decision.</p>\n<h3>Step two — ensure high-quality UI/UX design</h3>\n<p>Though it is essential to follow the “don&#8217;t-judge-a-book-by-its-cover” mantra, the UI/UX constituent of your platform will undoubtedly contribute to both the first and, figuratively speaking, second impression on your users.</p>\n<p>An NFT marketplace should be both easy to navigate and appealing to look at. Make sure that the design of your platform will be understandable so that everyone can effortlessly figure out how to use it.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Our UI/UX design services can help define your unique brand voice with no extra resources from your side","url":"https://pixelplex.io/ui-ux-design/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>Step three — get down to the development</h3>\n<p>Once you have come to terms with the design idea, you can move on to development.

Estimate the capabilities of each option and work out which will be the most viable.</p>\n<p>During this stage you will also need to take care of smart contract development. It is highly advisable to hire experienced smart contract developers who will help you deploy bug-free and high quality smart contracts that will contribute to the frictionless functioning of your NFT marketplace.</p>\n<h3>Step four — carry out testing and deployment</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this step is to detect any bugs and arising issues that might hamper the platform’s performance, and fix them promptly. A team of <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/quality-assurance/\">QA engineers</a> will need to conduct all-encompassing software testing of all platform components and ensure that everything runs smoothly.</p>\n<p>Upon completion of the quality assurance process, your NFT platform can be deployed.</p>\n<h3>Step five — provide post-launch support</h3>\n<p>Once you have your project deployed, do not forget about post-launch support. Try to update and enrich your NFT platform with new and advanced features as often as possible.</p>\n<p>Crucially, resolve any occurring bugs and inefficiencies asap. By doing this, you will ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"See why celebrities all over the globe are joining the NFT craze","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/celebrities-join-nft-craze/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"blockchains-for-nft-platform-development\">Lowdown on blockchains for NFT platform development</h2>\n<p>The blockchain that you choose as the foundation of your NFT marketplace will strongly influence the overall success of your project.

It also stands behind the introduction of non-fungible tokens of appreciation (NFTAs) which are minted in compliance with the Cardano CIP-721 metadata standard. Examples of Cardano NFT platforms include jpg.store, Tokhun, and Galaxy of Art.</p>\n<h3>Solana</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-soars-10-as-325-million-reinstated-on-wormhole/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solana</a> blockchain makes use of the unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. It enables the creation of advanced and fully-fledged NFT marketplaces such as Solanart, Solsea, and Metaplex.</p>\n<p>Solana also has its own custom token standard, called SPL, and a cross-chain bridge — Wormhole — that allows users to lock ERC-20 tokens in an Ethereum smart contract and then mint the corresponding SPL tokens on the Solana chain.</p>\n<h3>WAX</h3>\n<p>Commonly referred to as a green NFT minting machine, <a href=\"https://hypebeast.com/2022/1/wax-blockchain-nft-10-million-account-holders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">WAX</a> is a great option for developing NFT marketplaces. The blockchain is said to consume about 125,000x less energy per transaction compared to Ethereum. So far, it has been used to establish outstanding platforms such as NeftyBlocks and AtomicHub.</p>\n<h3>Tezos</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/englands-manchester-united-set-to-unveil-tezos-blockchain-shirt-sponsorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tezos</a> has provided a rock-solid foundation for multiple NFT marketplaces, including Kalamint, Hic et Nunc, Bazaar Market, OneOf, and Objkt.

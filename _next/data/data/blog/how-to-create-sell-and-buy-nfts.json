Yes, once again</h2>\n<p>You may have come across an explanation of NFTs in the news or social media a thousand times (a big hello to the TikTok generation), and in all probability, you‚Äôve learned it by heart. But practice makes perfect ‚Äî so let‚Äôs solidify that knowledge once again.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/non-fungible-tokens/\">non-fungible token</a> (NFT) is a non-interchangeable digital asset created on the blockchain. It represents real-world objects like art, music, virtual lands, collectibles, videos, GIFs, images, and in-game items.</p>\n<p>NFTs are a ground-breaking notion in the crypto space. They enable artists and content creators to easily monetize their works, without having to rely on galleries and auction houses. This means that artists no longer need to turn to intermediaries to sell their wares. Instead, they have the ability to sell them directly to the consumer in the form of an NFT and get paid for what belongs to them.</p>\n<p>As far as NFT buyers/owners are concerned, what‚Äôs noteworthy is that they can enjoy the uniqueness of the acquired NFT. Plus, given that non-fungible tokens are based on the blockchain, it‚Äôs possible to track their entire history. This provides better transparency as well as provenance and verification of their authenticity.</p>\n<p>Whether you like it or not, NFTs are here and they are here to stay. So instead of grumbling and nagging, perhaps it would be wiser to come up with your own idea of what to tokenize üòâ</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Our blockchain experts have made an exhaustive comparison between the Ethereum and Flow blockchains.

These days, the number of blockchains used in NFT campaigns is abundant. Apart from Ethereum ‚Äî the leading one ‚Äî you can consider many other options such as Flow, Tron, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, EOS, Tezos, and WAX. Take into account that each of them possesses its own token standard, compatible marketplaces, and wallet services. So, if you create an NFT on Flow, for instance, you will be able to sell it only on platforms that provide support for Flow‚Äôs assets.</p>\n<p>As well as this, it‚Äôs important to <strong>bear in mind gas fees</strong>. The majority of marketplaces support NFTs that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Consequently, the increasing popularity of Ethereum is resulting in higher gas fees.</p>\n<p>There is a viable solution to this, though: you‚Äôll be better off if you select the less (or least) active times of the week. It‚Äôs been <a href=\"https://medium.com/dextf/ethereum-how-to-save-even-more-on-gas-price-with-a-weekly-plan-c6689ac09fe6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">established</a> that on average the best time to submit transactions and thereby save on Ethereum gas fees is between 2 pm and 8 pm NYC time.</p>\n<p>There is one more tip we are eager to share with you. If you are going to mint your NFT art on the Ethereum blockchain, for instance, you will need to <strong>choose a suitable wallet</strong> that will provide support to Ethereum-based assets and be compatible with ERC-721 standards. Currently, the most notable wallets are MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Need a trustworthy partner to foster your NFT development?

To do this, go to ‚Äú<strong>My Collection</strong>‚Äù and specify the percentage ‚Äî it is possible to set a fee up to 10%. Then provide the payout address where you wish to receive those fees. The OpenSea platform cannot split royalties to multiple addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/opensea-website-screenshots-2.png\" alt=\"The UI of Fee settings tab on OpenSea website\" width=\"1556\" height=\"686\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, the process of NFT art creation on OpenSea is quite simple.

In the tech world, with every innovation comes the possibility of fraud. And unfortunately, NFTs are no exception.</p>\n<p>The crypto space has been dealing with scams for years already and with the advent of NFTs, wrongdoers found a new loophole for their skulduggery. Being a new and underexplored trend, NFTs have become the target of a number of scams.</p>\n<p>Below we provide an overview of the most common NFT scams that you need to know about when creating, selling, and buying NFTs.</p>\n<h3>Artist impersonation</h3>\n<p>Artist impersonation has been the most prevalent scam so far. It refers to the situation where someone steals a work from a digital artist and presents it as their own. Scam artists normally sell popular NFT artworks at a low price and manage to take in credulous fans.</p>\n<p>A good example of this is the recent <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/01/banksy-website-promotes-fake-nft-in-apparent-hack.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Banksy scam</a> where the buyer paid more than $300,000 in ETH for a fake Banksy NFT (luckily, the hacker returned all the money to the collector ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø).</p>\n<p>To prevent this from happening, it is necessary to check if the artist you are buying from or the artwork itself is verified. This is possible to do with the help of special NFT provenance platforms.</p>\n<h3>Phony storefronts</h3>\n<p>Multiple fake storefronts have become a widespread thing in the NFT space. Their URLs usually look the same as those of the original stores. On top of that, the site itself is almost identical to the normal one. Wrongdoers might thereby trick you into buying a fake NFT or granting them your private key.</p>\n<p>Watch out for suspicious URLs and the way in which you are directed to the website. Additionally, if you have run into a fake storefront, report it immediately.</p>\n<h3>Fake giveaways/airdrops</h3>\n<p>Crypto has always been a magnet for fake airdrops. Thousands of such scams are reported on a daily basis. Scammers use popular brands and personalities associated with cryptos and target enthusiasts by offering them free NFTs, tokens, and other cryptocurrencies. One of the most <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/scams-and-fraud-bubble-up-as-nft-mania-takes-hold-2021-03-31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">infamous cases</a> so far was the fake giveaway of Rarible tokens.</p>\n<p>As sad as it sounds, this trend is bound to continue. Scammers make use of communities on social media platforms such as Instagram, Discord, and Telegram and try to catch the attention of users with tempting offers, such as giving away fake and non-existent NFTs for free.</p>\n<p>If somebody sends you a link to join such a community, simply verify it by searching on Google or Twitter. If there is no information about them on the official websites/pages of marketplaces, this means that those accounts are fake.</p>\n<p>These are just some of the examples of existing scams. Forewarned is forearmed ‚Äî be careful and don‚Äôt take the bait!</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts</h2>\n<p>Non-fungible tokens open up new and unlimited horizons for artists and collectors. Their popularity is growing at breakneck speed and judging by this it‚Äôs safe to say that NFTs are here to stay. Though they are still nascent and face some challenges, improvements are being made on a regular basis. For now, remember that discretion is the better part of valor ‚Äî so try to avoid any doubtful or suspicious NFT-related activities which might lead to unfavorable consequences.</p>\n<p>If you are a newcomer in the sphere and eager to kickstart your NFT journey, we have you covered.

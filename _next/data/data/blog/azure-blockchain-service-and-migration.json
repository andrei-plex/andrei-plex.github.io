We decided to provide an overview of the retiring service and guide existing projects to a smooth transition to another cloud-based platform or self-managed infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Continue reading to learn more about Microsoft Azure Blockchain Service and find our migration tips for businesses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-azure-blockchain-service\">What is Azure Blockchain Service?</h2>\n<p>Microsoft Azure Blockchain Service is a BaaS platform that automates many aspects of blockchain networks through ready configuration options. It allows blockchain platforms to be built and maintained easily and effortlessly.</p>\n<p>Azure Blockchain reduces initial costs related to both the setup of the blockchain network and its maintenance. These cost benefits often outweigh traditional solutions.</p>\n<p>The platform also offers easy integration with third-party blockchain services. Additional services, built for the blockchain networks by the Microsoft Blockchain partners, are easily accessible through Azure Marketplace.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history-and-availability\">History and availability</h2>\n<p>Microsoft Azure, which offers a suite of cloud services, has been around since 2010. It provides a wide variety of services that are not exclusively related to the blockchain: examples include database products, virtual machines, and web hosting platforms.</p>\n<p>In 2015 Azure began enlisting several blockchain platforms on the <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-ca/marketplace/apps/category/blockchain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Azure marketplace</a>, allowing clients to instantly launch the likes of Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda. The Marketplace also includes multiple tools for the design and maintenance of blockchain networks.</p>\n<p>In May 2018 Microsoft introduced Azure Blockchain Service to the Marketplace. This service allows customers to quickly deploy a blockchain network, create or join consortiums, add members to the consortiums, and deploy blockchain applications at scale.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has decided to retire its Azure Blockchain Service in September 2021.</p>\n<h2 id=\"networks-supported-by-the-azure-blockchain\">Networks supported by the Azure Blockchain</h2>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Service supports numerous blockchain network types such as Quorum Ledger, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda.</p>\n<p>When used as a part of Azure Blockchain Service, these networks need very little administration from the customer side.  What’s more, they are provided at no additional cost.</p>\n<p>With no need for active management, customers can focus on application development and the implementation of business logic on top of the blockchain. In addition, application developers can make use of many of the open-source tools and platforms available on the market.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check out our comparison of public and private blockchains with the benefits of both","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/public-vs-private-blockchain/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"azure-blockchain-service-features\">Azure Blockchain Service features</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/azure-blockchain-service-features.png\" alt=\"A person building a network based on Azure Blockchain ecosystem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Service is a managed ledger service that enables users to launch and operate blockchain networks at scale using managed Azure infrastructure. Users are given the power of unified control over both the infrastructure and the networks that they provide.</p>\n<p>In addition to simplified network deployment and operations, Azure Blockchain Service offers many other useful features related to performance, service, maintenance, security, monitoring, logging, and consortium management.</p>\n<h3>Deployment and operations</h3>\n<p>The development of networks on the Azure Blockchain Service is primarily done using three tools: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/service/create-member-cli\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Azure CLI</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/service/connect-vscode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Visual Studio Code</a>, and the Azure portal that has built-in assistance for blockchain. Blockchain network deployment is straightforward.</p>\n<p>The service includes the deployment of both the validator and transaction nodes. In addition, there are virtual networks for service-managed storage and security isolation. When a new member of the network is deployed, users can choose to join or create a consortium.</p>\n<p>The consortiums enable various parties to communicate securely and share data using the blockchain infrastructure and all its underlying advantages. With the Azure Blockchain Service, the deployments and provisioning of the blockchain network can be done in just a few minutes, unlike the traditional, non-BaaS methods which took days.</p>\n<h3>Performance and service</h3>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Service offers basic and standard tiers. The tiers offer different performance, storage, and support capabilities. The basic tier is usually recommended for proof of concept deployments and testing purposes. The standard tier, meanwhile, is recommended for production-grade deployments.</p>\n<p>The standard tier also offers better compute infrastructure. While both tiers include at least one transaction node, the standard tier includes two validator nodes. Basic tier availability is not guaranteed, but standard tier service will be available for over 99.99% of the time.</p>\n<h3>Maintenance and security</h3>\n<p>Once the initial blockchain network member is set up on Azure Blockchain Service, it can be joined by additional transaction nodes. The transaction nodes are secured through firewall rules and need to be configured for access.</p>\n<p>All transaction nodes encrypt the data using TLS (Transport Layer Security). Many other security schemes are involved when securing transaction node access, such as basic authentication, access keys, and Azure Active Directory integration.</p>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Service makes sure all of the member nodes continue to host the latest security mechanisms through automatic updates. Besides the security updates, the nodes always host the latest updates of the operating system and ledger software stacks. The managed service requires very little DevOps activity, compared to traditional IaaS blockchain nodes.</p>\n<h3>Monitoring and logging</h3>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Service works alongside Azure Monitor Service, which uses multiple system metrics to provide insights into the status of infrastructure and application resources. Azure Blockchain Service allows monitoring the CPU, memory, and storage utilization of any node in the network.</p>\n<p>In addition, the monitoring feature gives valuable insights into other node statistics such as the transactions and blocks mined, transaction queue depth, and active connections. Azure gives the user control over the customization of the monitoring views, according to their priorities.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the system is capable of alerting users via email or push notification as well as triggering other integrated components when the defined metric threshold value is passed.</p>\n<h3>Consortium management</h3>\n<p>A consortium is a group consisting of network members who share some bounded logic and transact in a multi-party process. In Azure Blockchain Service the consortiums are managed through predefined smart contracts that determine what actions members in the consortium are allowed to take. The governance rules are imposed by the administrator of the consortium. Joining the consortium is allowed only by invitation. Consortium management is done programmatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"azure-blockchain-workbench\">Azure Blockchain Workbench</h2>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Workbench is a set of Azure services and tools put together by Microsoft to offer users the fastest way to start blockchain development. The Workbench provides the necessary infrastructure for building and deploying blockchain applications, enabling data and process sharing between multiple businesses securely and reliably.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the managed nature of applications built with Azure Blockchain Workbench, the app developers can focus solely on creating business logic and the provision of smart contracts. The Workbench also helps developers to easily automate common development tasks.</p>\n<p>The primary function of the Azure Blockchain Workbench is to serve as a suite for the simple creation of blockchain applications. Users of Blockchain Workbench can define blockchain applications through configuration and by writing smart contract code.</p>\n<p>Created blockchain applications and users can be effectively managed using the Workbench, as it provides a web application and REST APIs for management. The administrators manage application access and can assign user roles.</p>\n<p>The Blockchain Workbench offers a set of interfaces that simplify the integration of blockchain applications with multiple distributed ledger technologies, storage services, and database offerings. At the same time, Azure Blockchain Workbench simplifies the setup of consortium blockchain networks with Azure Resource Manager templates. In this way, the application and all other components necessary for building the consortium can be easily deployed.</p>\n<p>Azure Blockchain Workbench enables the use of Windows Active Directory that further abstracts the blockchain identities (normally represented as the addresses in the network), making it simpler to <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/enterprise-blockchain-development/\">build enterprise applications</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"azure-blockchain-development-kit\">Azure Blockchain Development Kit</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/azure-blockchain-development-kit.png\" alt=\"A person examining a blue block with a magnifier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-the-azure-blockchain-development-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Azure Blockchain Development Kit</a> offers tools and templates for the development of blockchain solutions and for their integration with the rest of the Azure infrastructure.

All existing deployments are expected to be supported until then. The shutdown applies only to the Azure Blockchain Service. Microsoft Azure Blockchain Workbench will continue operating.</p>\n<p>For companies that are in the <strong>pilot or production stages</strong>, Microsoft advises two options.</p>\n<p>The first is pivoting to the Quorum Blockchain Service, managed by ConsenSys. The service supports Quorum as ledger technology. This alternative has even fewer management overheads than the Azure Blockchain Service. Microsoft highly recommends migration of the existing data onto Quorum Blockchain Service with ConsenSys’ help.</p>\n<p>The second option is to have an Azure VM-based deployment. For this purpose, customers can turn to several blockchain resource management templates to deploy blockchain on IaaS VMs. Customers can continue using Quorum’s ledger technology. As an alternative, they can transition to a self-managed infrastructure and blockchain stack using Azure’s virtual machines.</p>\n<p>For companies that are in the <strong>new deployment or evaluation phase</strong>, Microsoft advises using either <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/consensys.quorum-dev-quickstart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Quorum template</a> or <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/consensys.hyperledger-besu-quickstart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Besu template</a> from Azure Marketplace.</p>\n<p>The migration of the production workload should be done by first downloading the blockchain data and then transitioning this data to the preferred alternative. Although the process sounds simple, it is more complicated than designing the blockchain from the ground up. For this reason, the advice is to seek assistance from companies that have previous experience and expertise in migrating blockchains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Azure’s BaaS service was a great solution that allowed its users to quickly deploy a blockchain network, create or join consortiums, add members to the consortiums, and deploy blockchain applications at scale. Unfortunately, Microsoft decided to retire the Azure Blockchain Service in September 2021 forcing many companies to look into migrating their projects.</p>\n<p>Migration can pose many challenges and entail high expenses because of the technical complexity associated with deploying and maintaining these types of solutions. A good idea is to turn to an experienced blockchain development company focusing on delivering end-to-end blockchain platforms. With a well-versed team of engineers, they can help with migration of your Azure BaaS project to any other platform.</p>\n"}]}],"required_time_to_read_the_news":"","show_contact_block":false,"default_prefix":"","author":{"name":"Alex Zakharenkov","photo":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/a.zakharenkov.jpg","description":"Copywriter","social_networks":false,"internal_url":"","seo_title":"","seo_description":"","seo_keywords":"","seo_image":false,"default_prefix":""},"youtube_link":"","breadcrumbs_title":"Azure Blockchain Service and Migration","author_name":"PixelPlex Team","post_modified":"2022-08-15 14:27:38"},"contacts":{"email":"info@pixelplex.io","address":[{"entry":"Suite 31"},{"entry":"520 West 28th St."},{"entry":"New York, NY 10001"}],"url":"https://pixelplex.io/contacts/"},"showMoreInfo":[{"id":32258,"slug":"web5-explained","preview":{"url":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/web5-explained-main-1600-1.jpg","alt":"Web5 as a combination of Web3 and Web2","resized":{"1000x510":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-1000x510.jpg","690x517":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-690x517.jpg","480x360":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-480x360.jpg","375x280":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-375x280.jpg","279x207":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-279x207.jpg","218x156":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-218x156.jpg","120x120":"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/auto-resized/32286-120x120.jpg"}},"category":{"slug":"blockchain","term_id":148,"name":"Blockchain"},"date":"20220901","title":"What Is Web5?

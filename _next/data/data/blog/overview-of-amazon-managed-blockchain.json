But we have to admit that it’s gospel truth as our team of expert blockchain developers at PixelPlex has <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/blockchain-development/\">demonstrated</a> how this miraculous technology can benefit millions of users with its limitless potential.</p>\n<p>Blockchain was already a serious game-changer by the time Amazon Web Services (AWS), the most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform with total revenue of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/233725/development-of-amazon-web-services-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">$45.37 billion</a> in 2020, introduced its own blockchain solution — Amazon Managed Blockchain. It enables users to deploy secure blockchain networks via the well-known open-source frameworks Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum.</p>\n<p>The service aims to provide companies and individuals with a quick and easy way to install their own blockchain networks for serving their particular purposes. What’s more, AWS blockchain is poised to remove the need for manually provisioning hardware, customizing software, and configuring networking and security components.</p>\n<p>Read on to find out more about Amazon Managed Blockchain, its key characteristics, functioning principles, and the most notable success stories.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lowdown-on-amazon-web-services\">Lowdown on Amazon Web Services</h2>\n<p>Before we actually get started with Amazon blockchain, let’s delve into Amazon Web Services and examine what makes it so special and highly popular.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">AWS</a> is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms as well as APIs on a pay-as-you-go basis. Just like other public cloud vendors, such as Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, it takes care of managing and maintaining hardware alongside the entire infrastructure. By doing this, it exempts both businesses and individuals from running and handling the sometimes complex resources on site.</p>\n<p>Currently, AWS is used by startups, large enterprises, and even government agencies worldwide. It provides a wide range of global cloud-based products such as storage, databases, analytics, several development and management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications, and much more.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Take a peek at our Azure Blockchain Service overview and learn how to migrate","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/azure-blockchain-service-and-migration/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"key-benefits-of-aws\">Key benefits of AWS</h2>\n<p>AWS remains the most popular vendor in the cloud infrastructure services market and controls <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">32% of the entire market share</a>. Here are some of the most substantial benefits of this sought-after Amazon suite.</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>1.</strong> AWS has a rich variety of services, with each of them designed to serve one particular functionality — but you are still free to mix and match different services to meet the needs of your app.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>2.</strong> The entire infrastructure is failure-prone and securely protected. Top security is apparently the number one priority for AWS, which is why it makes use of an end-to-end approach consisting of physical, operational, and software measures, which guarantee adequate protection.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>3.</strong> AWS possesses great scalability capacity. By using AWS tools, including Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, you can scale your app up and down and adjust it to your current business needs.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>4.</strong> AWS is widely reckoned to be cost-effective. You are asked to pay only for the computer power and resources that you use, without any long-term contracts and upfront commitments.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>5.</strong> AWS demonstrates remarkable flexibility. It allows you to choose any operating system, programming language, database, and so on. You get a virtual environment that enables you to upload the services and software that your app needs. This tends to make the migration process for the existing apps much simpler, while also presenting unique options for creating new solutions from scratch.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"what-about-aws-blockchain\">What about AWS blockchain?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/what-about-aws-blockchain.jpg\" alt=\"Hands holding Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum based platforms next to the AWS logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>In the face of the ever-increasing popularity of blockchain, Amazon couldn’t sit on the sidelines. Therefore, back in 2018, the company unveiled its Amazon Managed Blockchain that didn’t take long to prove a success.</p>\n<p>Amazon blockchain emerged as a highly scalable solution that supports open-source frameworks such as <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/smart-contracts-in-hyperledger-fabric-blockchain/\">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and Ethereum. It allows users to set up blockchain networks with just a couple of clicks. Each network member pays for their resources based on the pay-as-you-go model with no upfront costs. Hourly rates are billed per second, whereas virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoints, created to access resource endpoints, are billed separately.</p>\n<p>Amazon blockchain greatly reduces overheads related to network creation. It automatically scales to fit the individual requirements of each and every app. In sum, the solution contributes to the successful set-up of blockchain networks, simplifies the entire management of your certificates, and provides you with an opportunity to invite new members to join the network.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"See how we help our clients create custom Hyperledger Fabric infrastructure","url":"https://pixelplex.io/hyperledger-development/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"the-technicalities-of-aws-blockchain\">The technicalities of AWS blockchain</h2>\n<p>Amazon Managed Blockchain takes on the responsibility for providing nodes, establishing the overall infrastructure, and scaling the network. As a result, customers get a fully functioning blockchain network setup within a short time frame. The solution also offers simple APIs that make it possible for users to vote on membership rights within their networks and scale up and down without breaking a sweat.</p>\n<p>This blockchain gives users a lot of options, with various combinations of computing and memory capabilities, enabling them to select the most appropriate set of resources for their blockchain apps. It also secures certificates for access control via AWS Key Management Service, thus removing the need for users to install their own certificate storage. What’s more, Amazon blockchain platform facilitates the replication of all transactions to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/qldb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Amazon Quantum Ledger Database</a> (QLDB), which provides a fully managed ledger database with a centralized, trusted authority.</p>\n<p>Another aspect worth highlighting is that no one actually owns the network. Given that blockchain networks are decentralized by default, they remain active even after the initial creator exits the scene. Each member can vote on network-wide settings and configure voting rules (for instance, they can decide whether the majority rules or one member makes the decision). Blockchain on AWS, for its part, takes care of managing shared components, including the ordering service and network settings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walkthrough-overview-of-hyperledger-fabric-and-ethereum-frameworks\">Walkthrough overview of Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum frameworks</h2>\n<p>Initially, Amazon Managed Blockchain provided support only for Hyperledger Fabric.

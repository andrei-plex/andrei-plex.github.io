AI-controlled machines will be used to perform super-precision eye surgeries on everyone at low cost, treating cataracts, glaucoma, myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. Moreover, PixelPlex has already developed an <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/artificial-intelligence-retina-disease-symptom-analyzer/\">AI retina disease diagnosis tool</a> that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to pinpoint defective symptoms and record data to be used in diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Gone are the days of awkward limb movements and slow processing, replaced with near-human actions and instantaneous response. Prosthetics fitted with AI will be able to instantly send neural impulses and have the flexibility to move with a 100% range of motion and fraction-of-an-inch precision. Cyborgs will walk among us and disabilities become a rare sight.</p>\n<h2>Future of AI: Processing of Emotion</h2>\n<p>AI has the ability to continually learn (with only hard drive capacity stopping it), meaning that it has the infinite ability to keep on improving without other limitations such as corruption or emotions. Perhaps it may learn how to process and express emotion, working as 24/7 therapists or offering emotional support services.</p>\n<p>As the AI sorts out the gargantuan amounts of information that we give it as we discuss our struggles and problems, we are given the best solution indicated by their algorithms within nanoseconds. As a result, we will have people happier than ever, relationships more stable, and mental illness on a sharp decline.</p>\n<h2>AI in Our Daily Lives</h2>\n<p>As we shape our lives around the development of technology, we will soon be completely reliant upon AI. The existence of Google Home and Echo Dot’s Alexa proves that we are amid an age that relies on asking robots to help us remember things, and the fact that they are becoming more and more commonplace in each household contributes to this point.</p>\n<p>In half a decade, every house is a “smart” house that comes with a little Jiminy Cricket that resonates within the physical gypsum walls and the ones surrounding our brains. Schools engage in individual-specific teaching done by computer programs with algorithms that learn and utilize the best way a student learns, making the acquisition of knowledge a right to everyone.</p>\n<p>Every move of ours is watched and analyzed by AI so they can keep up with our nuances. Nothing is forgotten, everything is easily recorded; news has never traveled so fast, history has never been more accurate.</p>\n<h2>Future of AI: Routine Tasks Automation</h2>\n<p>Advancing in quick decision-making skills that deal with life and death, self-driving cars will become foolproof and a necessity in every household in the future. People driving at the wheel will be regarded as a danger to others as they are inclined to accidents caused by human error — thus only highly specialized persons shall be allowed to take up the wheel. Mundane errands such as grocery shopping are still equally as mundane, except now they’re completed over the internet, with drones and automated cars delivering goods to our waiting arms.</p>\n<p>Tasks now wait on us rather than the other way around, giving us more time to participate in recreational activities and hobbies. Our lives are at their highest efficiencies, and work and play are easily balanced.</p>\n<h2>Future Outlook on AI</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://backend.pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/future-of-artificial-intelligence-2.jpg\" alt=\"An AI-based robot with man's hands\" width=\"2048\" height=\"938\" /></p>\n<p>One thing leads to another, like a snowball effect, causing us to tumble forward in an avalanche of technological innovation pushing the limits of technological capabilities. We stand upon the shoulders of the giants before us, using their breakthroughs for making things quicker, more responsive, more personal, more intelligent, more expansive.</p>\n<p>Maybe everything written here will come true, or maybe things will go awry and we’ll end up in a post-apocalyptic robot-dominated society. Who knows what the future of artificial intelligence will be like? It’s hard to say since we’re flying past at a speed where everything outside the window is a blur. However, among the indistinct, tangled mess of the future, one thing is certain — the possibilities are vast and endless.</p>\n"}]}],"seo_title":"The Future of Artificial Intelligence","seo_description":"What is the future of artificial intelligence?

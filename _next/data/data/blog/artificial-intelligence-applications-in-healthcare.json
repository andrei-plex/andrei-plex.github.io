As a result, only 1 out of 10 newly developed drugs ever reach the mass market despite the meticulous drug development R&amp;D process. This state of the pharmaceutical industry is influencing experts to consider new innovative ways to manage workflow.</p>\n<p>Strategies involving AI to assist in the drug development decision-making process are predicted to revolutionize the industry and increase in size up to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1085156/biopharma-ai-market-global-size-by-application/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">$3 billion</a> by 2025. Artificial intelligence can optimize innovation, improve the efficiency of research and testing, and provide new tools for doctors, patients, insurers, and regulators to meet market demands.</p>\n<p>Every stage of the pharmaceutical R&amp;D process can be improved by AI and lead to increased efficiency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Literature survey</strong>. Researchers around the world publish their findings daily in the form of research papers, patents, and other types of gray literature. It is just not possible to collate the information from all of the published documents. Artificial intelligence algorithms can analyze the available literature and extract valuable insights to help researchers make informed decisions early on in the R&amp;D process.</li>\n<li><strong>Identification of principal targets for intervention</strong>. Understanding the biological origin of a disease and its resistance mechanism is the second stage in the development of a new drug. It is essential to identify principal target proteins for disease treatment. Despite the availability of data from different sources, the discovery of viable target pathways remains a great challenge for researchers. This process requires the integration and analysis of all the data to find a relevant pattern which is a perfect task for machine learning algorithms trained for pattern matching. These algorithms analyze the available data and automatically identify the target proteins for intervention.</li>\n<li><strong>Discovery of possible drug candidates</strong>. After the identification of targets, researchers must find the compound that will interact with selected target molecules in the desired way. This process includes scanning millions of candidate compounds and studying their effects and side-effects on the target. Machine learning algorithms can help researchers narrow down the selection to the best drug candidates, as they are able to rapidly synthesize the information about the so-called structure fingerprints and molecular descriptors to predict the suitability of a candidate molecule.</li>\n<li><strong>Clinical trials</strong>. The success of a clinical trial depends on the accurate selection of suitable candidates. The selection of wrong candidates can prolong the clinical trials and increase the cost of the drug discovery process. Artificial intelligence can help the researchers identify suitable candidates for clinical trials. Machine learning makes use of data to ensure the proper distribution for groups of participants. At this stage of a new drug development, AI algorithms monitor &amp; predict trial cost, enrollment, and quality. They can also serve as an early warning system for a clinical trial that is not producing conclusive and/or expected results.</li>\n<li><strong>Selection of biomarkers for disease diagnosis</strong>. It is possible to identify the disease either by genome sequencing or by utilizing the biological markers. Genome sequencing is a method that involves expensive lab equipment as well as expert knowledge. On the other hand, the biomarker approach is more economical and reliable. At the same time, their discovery is challenging and involves a lot of manual work. Artificial intelligence algorithms help automate the identification of suitable candidate biomarkers, which in turn, increase the prospects of success and decrease the expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"personalized-medicine-applications\">Personalized medicine applications</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/personalized-medicine-applications-in-healthcare.jpg\" alt=\"A hand holding a phone with icons of people and drugs on the screen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Another use case of AI in healthcare is <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2019/02/11/how-machine-learning-is-crafting-precision-medicine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">precision medicine</a>, a drug or treatment designed especially for an individual or a small group of people.

The biggest challenge with AI caused mistakes in healthcare is accountability, who is responsible for the error.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200512134541.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">recent study</a> has shown that, despite its potential to revolutionize modern medicine, AI-based medical imaging has serious shortcomings. AI algorithms used for medical image reconstruction result in unwanted alterations in data in the final images. These effects were not typically present in non-AI based imaging techniques.</p>\n<p>Even though medical errors occur in all healthcare systems, AI-caused errors are different for two reasons. First, patients and healthcare providers will react differently to injuries and suffering resulting from software than humans, seeking accountability. Second, the mistakes made by the AI system will have a large scale impact due to their widespread use, while human errors usually are localized affecting a limited number of patients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quality-of-data\">Quality of data</h3>\n<p>AI algorithms require a large volume of data for training. The available data often must be obtained from multiple different systems and sources in various formats. The collection process is expensive, increases the risk of having errors, and decreases the comprehensiveness of the dataset.</p>\n<p>Healthcare data may often be of low quality, subjective, and inaccurate. For example, electronic medical records are unstructured, patients may give false information, or data is incomplete due to privacy reasons.</p>\n<p>Machine learning algorithms used in healthcare systems are prone to algorithmic bias as well, sometimes predicting the higher likelihood of a disease based on gender or race when it may not be causal.</p>\n<p>For example, if the training data comes from academic medical centers, the machine learning algorithms will &#8220;know&#8221; less about, and therefore may establish a wrong diagnosis for patients that do not have access to academic medical centers. Similarly, when using speech-recognition AI to obtain the patient visit notes, algorithms may perform worse when patients belong to a gender or race that is underrepresented in the training data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"patient-privacy\">Patient privacy</h3>\n<p>Another challenge associated with AI in healthcare is related to privacy. The collection of data for training of AI algorithms can violate patient privacy. Already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/technology/google-university-chicago-data-sharing-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">law-suits</a> are being initiated due to the data-sharing between large healthcare providers and AI-companies. The privacy problem associated with AI algorithms goes further as these can predict a patient&#8217;s private information without it explicitly given in the data.</p>\n<p>Due to the seriousness of the privacy issue, some solutions have emerged, namely, to assemble high-quality datasets while protecting patient privacy, governments should be involved in providing the infrastructure. This infrastructure could range from setting standards for electronic health records to directly providing technical support for high-quality data-gathering efforts in health systems. The second approach to the solution is a direct investment in the creation of high-quality datasets. Two initiatives,  <a href=\"https://allofus.nih.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">All of Us </a>and <a href=\"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">BioBank</a>, have already developed plans to collect comprehensive healthcare data while facilitating the trust and participation of the patients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare\">The future of AI in healthcare</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/the-future-of-ai-in-healthcare.jpg\" alt=\"Cooperation of two health workers and a robot on checking data\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>As the paradigm shifts universally to conveying health from illness management to wellness maintenance, AI will play a very significant role in the personalization of healthcare. The availability of high-quality and comprehensive data will be an essential factor for the future success of AI in healthcare.</p>\n<p>IoT-enabled patient monitoring, asset tracking, and inventory management systems will provide invaluable data as input to AI algorithms to improve the health of patients, working conditions of health workers, and healthcare system operational efficiency.</p>\n<p>As the AI algorithms continue to get better at their tasks, the robots used in healthcare will become more prominent. Robots will assist and collaborate with humans to handle time- and energy-consuming tasks and help prevent operational errors.</p>\n<p>Patient privacy concerns are receding with the development of large scale AI systems for healthcare. In the future, blockchain technology will be combined with AI to mitigate privacy concerns and establish a <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/blockchain-and-iot-for-pharma-supply-chains/\">more secure and transparent healthcare system</a>.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence will enable doctors to access a large number of diagnostic resources on web databases and find the desired research study or clinical report faster and more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Despite common fears that AI may eventually replace or reduce the need for human doctors, recent studies have shown that AI will more likely benefit and enhance clinical diagnostics and decision-making processes than reduce the need for physicians. The synergy between artificial intelligence and human intelligence promises a bright future for the healthcare system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence is becoming an integral tool in healthcare. The most promising applications of AI are effective decision-making and processing of complex medical data. For example, AI benefits the doctors by providing a quantitative and qualitative assessment of patients that have multiple symptoms correlating with various genetic and physical conditions. In such cases, AI improves the accuracy of early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome prediction.</p>\n<p>As machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning, and robotics technologies progress many new applications of AI in healthcare will emerge. It is a crucial time for healthcare stakeholders to start incorporating AI in their work processes.</p>\n<p>PixelPlex, an <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/artificial-intelligence/\">AI development company</a>, can help healthcare providers to incorporate AI into their businesses.

Today, IBM has operations in more than 175 countries with over 375,000 employees. Throughout the years IBM has continuously focused its business operations towards high-value and more lucrative markets.</p>\n<p>As one of its latest developments, IBM has entered the world of blockchain. The company is actively contributing to Hyperledger, an umbrella project led by the Linux Foundation that promotes open-source blockchain. <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-hyperledger/\">Hyperledger</a> has several distributed ledger technology frameworks, and IBM leads the Hyperledger Fabric framework.</p>\n<p>Read on to find out more about the role of blockchain in IBM business, the IBM Blockchain Platform, IBM Blockchain solutions for healthcare, life sciences, supply chains, the financial industry, and identity management, and some of the most successful client stories.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ibm-and-blockchain-a-little-bit-of-history\">IBM and blockchain – a little bit of history</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ibm-and-blockchain-a-little-bit-of-history.jpg\" alt=\"A person holding a block next to the IBM logo and an hourglass\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>IBM got involved with blockchain and established itself as a leader in this field from the time of the first mass adoption of blockchain for applications other than Bitcoin. As one of the earliest contributors to the Hyperledger project, IBM joined with other organizations to form one of the main Hyperledger DLTs, Hyperledger Fabric. This DLT is mainly based on IBM&#8217;s OpenBlockchain, and IBM still remains the most active contributor to this open-source framework. IBM has adopted Hyperledger Fabric and now offers enterprise-grade DLT with privacy support as a service to its customers.</p>\n<p>Through the introduction of IBM Blockchain, the company has solved some of the toughest industry-specific problems such as increasing transparency in supply chains and preserving privacy in healthcare. IBM has also implemented thousands of end-to-end solutions using blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Until recently, blockchain has concerned IT managers because the benefits, drawbacks, and general operating principles of the new decentralized system have not been fully tested. In 2020, IBM contributed to the resolution of many concerns by driving its business operations towards bringing blockchain closer to enterprise users and making its value clear in network applications that need trust and transparency to operate. IBM has shown that blockchain is becoming a critical acceleration tool for digital transformation.</p>\n<p>IBM&#8217;s operations during 2020/21 coincided with various organizational needs due to the global pandemic. Supply chain disruptions re-emphasized the need for more transparent and visible logistics. IBM contributed to the resolution of such needs for medical equipment and supply by releasing their <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/rapid-supplier-connect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Rapid Supplier Connect</a>. Powered by IBM&#8217;s blockchain platform, this solution helped US and Canada&#8217;s healthcare organizations and government agencies quickly find and onboard additional suppliers of medical equipment in times of need.</p>\n<p>More recently IBM has been helping the government reinstall social operations through &#8220;new normal&#8221; regulations and tools. IBM launched <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Digital Health Pass</a>, a tool that allows people to securely verify their health status before attending an event or crossing a border. An IBM-led consortium has secured a project with the German government to extend this solution to include vaccination evidence. The solution uses the IBM blockchain platform as a backend while the health pass is presented to the user as an encrypted digital wallet on their smartphones with full control over what they share and with whom.</p>\n<p>IBM&#8217;s long-term relationships with financial institutions have been enhanced recently thanks to blockchain-based solutions. For example, the company has helped the Bank of Thailand launch the world&#8217;s first <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-10-05-Bank-of-Thailand-Launches-Worlds-First-Government-Savings-Bond-on-IBM-Blockchain-Technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">blockchain-based government savings bond</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ibm-blockchain-overview\">IBM Blockchain: overview</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">IBM Blockchain Platform</a> is a full-stack, managed blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering. The platform can be deployed on-premise, on IBM Cloud, or on any other single cloud or multi-cloud hybrid solution. Multiple deployment options (OpenShift, Kubernetes) and containerization options build on the versatility of the platform.</p>\n<h3>Main capabilities</h3>\n<p>The IBM Blockchain Platform offers many possibilities for blockchain network development, operation, governance, and expansion. One of the biggest advantages of the IBM Blockchain Platform is the simplicity it provides in creating and managing blockchain networks, channels, and smart contracts.</p>\n<p>In addition, the platform gives opportunities to grow blockchain networks by inviting new members, creating new channels, customizing policies, and managing the identity credentials of new network participants.</p>\n<h3>Core principles</h3>\n<p>IBM Blockchain Platform is founded on three main principles, which are also the main benefits of the platform: <strong>data finality</strong>, <strong>trust through transparency</strong>, and <strong>network privacy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The data finality principle is based on the blockchain&#8217;s property of immutability. Once committed, blockchain ledger data cannot be altered or removed. The only way to update data on the ledger is through a new transaction that must be verified and validated through established consensus.</p>\n<p>On IBM Blockchain Platform, all of the participants are known to other participants and are identifiable by them. This principle guarantees transparency and the building of distributed trust within a known business network. The principle also simplifies the fulfillment of regulatory requirements that dictate that certain information in a network is known (KYC). Thanks to the transparency principle, the blockchains on IBM&#8217;s platform do not require mining and inherently result in much faster transaction processing.</p>\n<p>IBM Blockchain Platform can guarantee the privacy of transactions and transaction data. Privacy on the platform is enabled using dedicated channels, private databases, and zero-knowledge-proof technology. Channels allow the exchange of information in an isolated way so it&#8217;s not presented to the entire network but only to selected participants. Private databases store sensitive private data alongside the ledger data. Finally, zero-knowledge-proof technology enables the verification of information validity without revealing the information itself.</p>\n<h3>IBM Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric</h3>\n<p>Hyperledger Fabric as a core underlying technology of IBM Blockchain Platform provides critical features that allow the building of reliable permissioned blockchain networks. The platform is intended for businesses of all sizes, large or small.</p>\n<p>Through its modular architecture, Hyperledger Fabric allows the implementation of a variety of cryptographic algorithms, identity schemes, consensus protocols, smart contracts, and other features of blockchain. As such, Hyperledger Fabric provides a solid foundation for decentralized business networks.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Everything you need to know about Hyperledger frameworks, tools, and applications is right here","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-hyperledger/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"ibm-blockchain-solutions-health-and-life-sciences\">IBM Blockchain solutions: health and life sciences</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ibm-blockchain-solutions-health-and-life-sciences.jpg\" alt=\"People delivering medical supplies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>IBM Blockchain solutions for healthcare and life sciences focus mainly on the promotion of critical privacy, interoperability, and traceability principles.

Many companies benefit from blockchain implementations in their business processes, and many have also developed blockchain-based services that they offer to other firms. IBM is one of these companies, but it stands out from the others. Despite earlier developments, IBM&#8217;s serious take on blockchain technology only started with Hyperledger, and the Hyperledger Fabric project in particular, in 2015. More than 5 years in, IBM is still the leading contributor to the Hyperledger Fabric project.</p>\n<p>IBM Blockchain Platform offers a solution for many industries such as financial, logistics, healthcare, and others. Its main benefits are transparency, visibility, security, and information immutability, all of which build trust in open and distributed environments. Perhaps one of the most attractive opportunities of IBM Blockchain Platform is the power of consortium. By utilizing and building applications with IBM&#8217;s platform you are stepping into a world of financial, business and trade resources and harvesting both technological and business benefits.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, stepping into this promising world may not always be easy for companies that are not experienced with Hyperledger Fabric and other IBM technologies. For these cases, it is best to work with a successful <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/enterprise-blockchain-development/\">blockchain company</a> that can guide you through this technological maze and make sure that you attain the most business benefits in the shortest time possible.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the PixelPlex <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/blockchain-development/\">rich project base</a>, and when you are convinced, send us an inquiry.

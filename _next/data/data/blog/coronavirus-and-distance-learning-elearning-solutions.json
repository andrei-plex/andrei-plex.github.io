At the moment, the COVID-19 coronavirus is the culprit, wreaking havoc and causing disruption for both students and educators alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recent-stats\">COVID-19 Recent Stats</h2>\n<p>The Coronavirus pandemic has spread throughout the world. As of January 2022 COVID-19 had been confirmed in over 220 countries with <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1043366/novel-coronavirus-2019ncov-cases-worldwide-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">352 million</a> people infected worldwide and the death toll of 5.6 million people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"effect-coronavirus\">The Effect of the COVID-19 Coronavirus on Education Around the World</h2>\n<p>The new COVID-19 coronavirus has already left its footprint in almost every corner of our world. At the time of writing, we have already witnessed total lockdowns in many countries with schools and universities resorting to distance learning. According to UNESCO, due to the coronavirus hazard, <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 100 countries have closed down schools and universities nationwide</a>, sending over half the world’s students home.</p>\n<p>And though some countries didn’t shut the educational facilities down, more and more teachers and students decide to cut classroom learning to a minimum and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1197154/covid-19-impact-childrens-education-number-of-households-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">go online</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4002 size-full radius8\" src=\"https://backend.pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-1.jpg\" alt=\"A map showing US School closures due to coronavirus outbreak\" width=\"1300\" height=\"920\" srcset=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-1.jpg 1300w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-1-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-1-768x544.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></p>\n<figure><figcaption style=\"color: grey; text-align: center;\">US School closures due to coronavirus outbreak. <a href=\"https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/map-coronavirus-and-school-closures.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4003 size-full radius8\" src=\"https://backend.pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"A map showing school closures due to coronavirus worldwide\" width=\"1300\" height=\"920\" srcset=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-2.jpg 1300w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-2-300x212.jpg 300w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-2-1024x725.jpg 1024w, https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-and-distance-learning-elearning-solutions-image-2-768x544.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" /></p>\n<figure><figcaption style=\"color: grey; text-align: center;\">School closures due to coronavirus worldwide. <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Under these heavy circumstances, many schools have already turned to eLearning solutions to effectively provide distance learning and remotely manage their students&#8217; performance. For instance, in the US, <a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/frisco/coronavirus/2020/03/15/frisco-isd-students-to-begin-elearning-march-17-board-votes-to-pay-staff-during-school-closures/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Frisco ISD district teachers started giving digital lessons</a> from March 17. They&#8217;ve done this by incorporating Google Classroom and a number of other eLearning platforms into their remote classwork. As we see it, many other states and districts will soon follow this practice to continue providing education to students at home using advanced capabilities of eLearning solutions.</p>\n<p>It is now obvious that the pandemic has boosted the online learning market. According to the statistics, the global eLearning solutions market is expected to reach <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130331/e-learning-market-size-segment-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$370 billion</a> by 2026.</p>\n<p>All this plays into the inevitable fact that all schools and universities will soon have to provide services using distance learning solutions with an adaptive, convenient UI/UX, and all the schooling and training capabilities ingrained within a mobile-first approach and built-in accessibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elearning-solutions\">eLearning and Distance Learning Solutions for Schools, Colleges and Universities</h2>\n<p>Schools, colleges, and universities require a whole framework of eLearning tools to effectively convey knowledge to students online. Learning Management Systems or LMS are a compilation of all the tools needed to cater to the educational requirements of schools from <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/benefits-of-blockchain-in-k-twelve-education/\">K-12 to the university level</a>.</p>\n<p>The must-have and most common features of these eLearning solutions include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtual classrooms with video conferencing</li>\n<li>Digital coursework and course creation</li>\n<li>Online quizzes and testing</li>\n<li>Gamification and interactive lessons</li>\n<li>Student work upload and assessment</li>\n<li>Grade overviews with a reporting dashboard</li>\n<li>Mobile-oriented learning and multi-device support</li>\n<li>ADA accessibility features to accommodate all students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The LMS offer sophisticated tutoring tools and insightful analytics powered by such disruptive technologies as AI and Big Data. These tools allow students to learn at a pace that&#8217;s convenient for them while also helping teachers automate processes and communicate with students via video calls, chats and comments on students&#8217; performance.</p>\n<p>It is known that eLearning solutions have a much higher <a href=\"https://techjury.net/stats-about/elearning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">retention rate of 25% to 60%</a>, compared to retention rates of conventional classroom studying at only 8-10%. Integrating a powerful LMS distance learning solution into your school’s IT infrastructure will surely have a positive impact on your students’ success and your school’s academic rankings.</p>\n<p>This advantage over <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/blockchain-education-use-cases-and-applications/\">conventional education</a> is achieved through a student-centric approach where students are plunged into an environment with enhanced collaboration, communication and gamification that engages them to learn and share their results, ultimately creating a social-networking experience. At the same time, teachers are provided a solution that streamlines educational content creation and enables customization of lessons based on the student&#8217;s capability and performance monitored by the learning management system. It also offers them attendance monitoring, dynamic grading, an overview dashboard, and much more.</p>\n<p>Need a learning management system like this in place at your educational institution? <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/contacts/\">Reach out to us</a> and we’ll provide you with a customized eLearning and distance learning solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-eLearning\">Top eLearning Solutions Features to Look Out For</h2>\n<p>Below is the list of the most crucial features of distance learning and eLearning solutions that make the educational process streamlined, fast-paced and efficient:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Custom course design</b>: easily create and customize courses enriched with all types of content: text, visual and audio.

Having this insightful data stored, organized, and visualized into a graphic dashboard with the help of your distance learning solution, make mindful decisions on how to improve on your students&#8217; results.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Refined student data analytics</b>: use insightful analytics of distance learning solutions designed to drag out key student performance indicators out of the pool of big data to the surface, and dynamically tune the learning experience using state-of-the-art AI technology.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Student and class profiles</b>: Make use of generated and aggregated data on the whole class and each and every individual student in their profile, presented via a user-friendly and convenient interface. See which <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/ar-and-vr-in-education-and-training/\">students</a> are struggling, what they are struggling with, and whether they fit in the current peer group. Make well-informed decisions and create the best environment for students to succeed.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Social-networking experience</b>: your LMS should be designed in the way students like to get by outside of class. The UI and UX should be intuitive, with seamless interactions and the ability to share learning experience and provide feedback via images, audio messages and videos.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Open and accessible knowledge base</b>: the eLearning solution must have a digital library available to students without boundaries and limitations. A universal knowledge base also stores the resources required by teachers, including user-generated lessons and assignments, study plans, student profiles, etc. This data is categorized, filtered and sorted to provide easy access.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Messenger &amp; notifications</b>: Enable open communication between teachers, the faculty, students, their parents and other parties involved in the educational process using a messenger built into the LMS.

No matter how skilled and experienced the developer, the sharp eye of a quality assurance engineer will spot even the tiniest bug in an application and report it as speedily as possible.</p>\n<p>Of course, we are not here to diminish the importance and professionalism of software developers. Instead, in this article we will fill you in on the essentials of a testing procedure, outline the types of software testing, and share some intriguing insights from our QA experts.</p>\n<p>Testing, testing…</p>\n<p>Let’s go!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-essence-of-software-testing\">The essence of software testing</h2>\n<p>The importance and usefulness of software testing cannot be overstated, and it is expected that the entire software testing market will hit <a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/software-testing-market#:~:text=Software%20Testing%20Market%20size%20exceeded,to%20boost%20the%20industry%20growth.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$60 billion</a> by 2027.</p>\n<p>Software testing per se is a process that helps verify that a software product runs as it is supposed to and hits specific quality benchmarks.</p>\n<p>During the procedure, QA engineers are responsible for searching for and identifying critical bugs and issues that may hinder the smooth functioning of an application and spoil the overall user experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-need-software-testing\">Why do you need software testing?</h2>\n<p>A well-executed software testing process can bring a bunch of great benefits, the most prominent being reduced costs, better security and quality of a final product, improved customer experience, and greater ROI.</p>\n<h3>Reduced costs</h3>\n<p>In 2021, data breach costs were estimated at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/987474/global-average-cost-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$4.24 billion</a>, which is the highest average total cost registered for the last 17 years. However, the earlier you spot a bug in a software application, the less expensive it becomes to fix it. That is why it is essential to implement a QA process and detect malfunctions at an early stage.</p>\n<h3>Better security and quality of a product</h3>\n<p>By carrying out safety and performance tests, you ensure that your software product fully complies with modern security standards and protocols. Plus, once your application has gone through the required functional and non-functional testing, you can then enhance your application’s speed and responsiveness, thus contributing to a better overall quality.</p>\n<h3>Improved customer experience and greater ROI</h3>\n<p>Put yourself in your user’s shoes and imagine how you’d feel if you had to deal with an app that has multiple bugs, endlessly urging you to turn to the support service.</p>\n<p>Quality assurance testing can help you retain customers by slashing the number of bugs to the barest minimum. Having fewer, or even zero, imperfections in your product will boost user confidence and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Besides, if your current users are satisfied with your application, they will provide encouraging feedback. This will drive more users to your product and increase your ROI.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Discover how we craft native and cross-platform solutions for any business purpose","url":"https://pixelplex.io/custom-software-development/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"overview-of-the-key-types-of-software-testing\">Overview of the key types of software testing</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/overview-of-the-key-types-of-software-testing.jpg\" alt=\"The comparison table of different types of software testing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Software testing types abound, so it is quite easy to get confused when itemizing them all. However, it’s possible to broadly categorize them into groups: manual vs automated testing, white box vs black box vs gray box testing, and functional vs non-functional testing.</p>\n<h3>Manual vs automation testing</h3>\n<p><strong>Manual testing</strong> is performed manually by a QA engineer. This approach grants testers more flexibility in their operational processes, yet at the same time it requires them to have impeccable skills, knowledge, and experience to be able to spot any bug.</p>\n<p><strong>Automation testing</strong>, for its part, relies on special automation tools. This approach allows testers to schedule the software testing anytime, anywhere, and spares them from having to spend too much time on test scripts and repeated testing.</p>\n<h3>White box vs black box vs gray box testing</h3>\n<p>Manual testing can also be further divided into the white box, gray box and black box software testing approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>White box testing</strong> allows a QA engineer to access source code, architecture, design documents, internal data structures, physical logic flow, and code comments. This approach allows for an insightful testing of the inner workings of a solution and helps reveal security findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Gray box testing</strong> is normally performed with credentialed access to the application logic flow charts or network infrastructure maps. This enables a QA tester to perform attacks from a user’s perspective so as to discover the potential impact of a bad actor’s ploy.</p>\n<p><strong>Black box testing</strong> is an exercise that closely resembles a cyberattack. A tester is not given any access to the application and is tasked with conducting reconnaissance to gain the sensitive data needed to proceed further. The key aim here is to find out whether an external attacker with no prior access might be able to infiltrate the application and its data.</p>\n<h3>Functional vs non-functional testing</h3>\n<p>Black box testing can also be subdivided into functional and non-functional software testing approaches.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional testing</strong> verifies that each functionality and feature of a software product works properly and in accordance with the parameters outlined by the client. Some examples of this software testing category would be unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.</p>\n<p><strong>Non-functional testing</strong>, on the other hand, is responsible for examining non-functional aspects of a software application — that’s to say, its performance, compatibility, usability, and so on. Put simply, it is used to test the behavior of a product and not the functionality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approaches-to-setting-up-a-software-testing-process\">Approaches to setting up a software testing process in your organization</h2>\n<p>Now that you know the basics of software testing, it’s time to move forward and look at how you can establish software testing in your organization — in other words, create an in-house testing team, turn to a QA consulting company, or hire a dedicated team.</p>\n<h3>Create an in-house testing team</h3>\n<p>There are multiple benefits to building your own software testing team. First of all, QA engineers will be working closely with developers, which undeniably streamlines communication and allows for more effective reporting.</p>\n<p>You and/or your tech team lead will also exercise better control over the entire testing process and make sure that everything runs smoothly. In addition, by creating an in-house department of QA engineers, you can substantially minimize the risk of your organization’s confidential information being breached.</p>\n<p>Even so, the overall process of recruiting QA specialists may turn out too time consuming, especially if you need a software testing team lead with rich experience. Moreover, if your software testing team has to work on numerous tasks at once, they might find themselves overloaded and as a result unwilling to practice new testing scenarios and approaches.</p>\n<h3>Refer to a QA consulting company</h3>\n<p>You can also consider augmenting your in-house testing team by hiring seasoned software testing consultants to bolster your current process. They will thoroughly analyze your existing testing workflows and look at your testing approaches with fresh eyes. Plus, QA consultants can establish a full-cycle QA process on their end, execute a QA audit, and find areas for improvement.</p>\n<p>The greatest advantage of having software testing consultants is that you will have the right to decide whether to accept their advice and proposals. You preserve absolute independence in your way of working.</p>\n<p>However, hiring QA consultants in addition to your existing team requires a lot of financial resources as you will have to maintain two teams at the same time.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Get insights into why you need IT consultants and see how to choose the right one","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/why-do-you-need-it-consultants/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>Hire or outsource a dedicated QA team</h3>\n<p>Hiring a dedicated QA team is rightly viewed as the golden mean between the two aforementioned options. Once you outsource QA experts, they will get down to work straight away, and you will not need to spend your time on recruiting, onboarding and training new staff. You can also choose the size of a QA team depending on your project requirements and complexity, and either expand or reduce the number of testers during the process.</p>\n<p>A dedicated QA team will concentrate exclusively on your project, allowing you to focus on your chief business processes. They will normally adopt the most advanced testing techniques and use the latest software testing tools to keep apace with other QA outsourcing companies.</p>\n<p>The minor here is that you will have to conduct a very thorough initial briefing and highlight the logic and minutiae of your product. Failure to do this may lead to a dedicated QA team struggling to deliver the very best quality outcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"steps-in-a-software-testing-life-cycle\">Steps in a software testing life cycle: PixelPlex’s approach</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/steps-in-a-software-testing-life-cycle.jpg\" alt=\"The six-step roadmap of a software testing life cycle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Each QA and software testing team employs its own unique approach to conducting a thorough software testing process — and here at PixelPlex we too have worked out and fine-tuned our own testing strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Analyze requirements and evaluate risks</strong></p>\n<p>Our QA engineers start with a comprehensive analysis of a product’s functional and non-functional requirements. They look into the specifics of a solution’s domain and conduct interviews with stakeholders (if needed).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Estimate the scope of work and allocate tasks in accordance with the team’s skillset</strong></p>\n<p>Given that a QA process is about ensuring a top quality solution (thanks Captain Obvious), we distribute testing responsibilities according to the skills and availability of our QA engineers. They estimate how much time the testing process will take, take heed of deadlines, and plan their time accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Design test cases</strong></p>\n<p>Once all requirements have been analyzed and the team composition decided, our QA engineers get down to producing test cases, where they describe test inputs, execution terms, and expected results from each individual case. Via test cases, QA specialists can be sure that a software solution is bug-free and runs as it should.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Execute test cases</strong></p>\n<p>Following the successful development of test cases, our quality assurance engineers get down to their execution. While performing this procedure, our testers closely watch for bugs and add information about them and the conditions under which they are discovered.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Track defects and test fixed bugs</strong></p>\n<p>When bugs have been reported, our development team immediately fixes them. Afterwards, QA engineers retest the product functionality and carry out regression testing. This is done to ensure that the fixed bugs have not caused new defects in the product.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6: Provide a test closure report</strong></p>\n<p>Once the test execution has been successfully completed and the bugs fixed, our QA engineers provide a comprehensive report, called test closure. The documents represent all the performed testing activities and final test results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-our-best-software-testing-practice\">Examples of our best software testing practice</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/examples-of-our-best-software-testing-practice.jpg\" alt=\"QA engineers examine software for bugs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Being a full-cycle development company, PixelPlex places special emphasis on software quality assurance.

Created by Andre Cronje, in February 2020, yearn.finance has swiftly grown into an ecosystem of DeFi protocols. It channels liquidity into DeFi sectors due to which yPools, one of the various Bitcoin pools, have earned some of the best lending rates in 2020. yearn.finance uses decentralized finance projects including Aave, dYdX, and Curve to optimize your token lending. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in yearn.finance has skyrocketed from $7 million to $949 million in just two weeks.</p>\n<p>Now, what is YFI? yearn.finance’s native governance token, YFI, is the second biggest DeFi coin in the decentralized finance crypto market as of September 2020, with a market capitalization surpassing $1.1 billion just one and a half months after its launch. Cronje transferred control of YFI stock to a multi-signature wallet, which requires 6 out of 9 participants to agree. As a decentralized finance Ethereum-based protocol, changes to yearn.finance ecosystem are made via on-chain voting.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s how yearn.finance works, in a nutshell:</strong></p>\n<p>yearn.finance moves tokens between Compound, Aave, dYdX, and Curve depending on which pool offers the highest yield. Using available on-chain information, the smart contracts automatically move funds to the best current option, guaranteeing optimum returns.</p>\n<p>When a user deposits funds in the yPool on Curve, they are converted to yTokens that allows users to earn lending fees plus the trading fees off of Curve. Cronje refers to the yTokens as “APR Oracles that determine the highest APR avenue.” If it is Aave, the yTokens are converted into aTokens that earn interest. Similarly, if the best APR offered is on Compound, the smart contract will return aTokens to Aave and convert the yTokens into Compound cTokens.</p>\n<p>A maximum supply limit of 30,000 YFI, a transparent launch, and an active developer has led yearn.finance to become one of the most successful DeFi protocols.</p>\n<p><strong>Total YFI Tokens:</strong> 30,000</p>\n<p><strong>Total Value Locked:</strong> $949.1M+</p>\n<p><strong>Token Type:</strong> DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, and sUSD stablecoins</p>\n<div class=\"wrapper-logo-icons\"><a href=\"https://yearn.finance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/globe-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"globe-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/iearn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/medium-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"medium-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iearn-finance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"github-icon\" /></a></div>\n<h3 id=\"compound\" style=\"font-size: 25px; font-weight: 400;\">Compound</h3>\n<div class=\"slide\">\n<p><iframe title=\"Robert Leshner: Compound – An Automated Money Market for Ethereum Tokens (#295)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oL11E4HuoNI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</div>\n<p>Compound has established itself as one of the dominant money market projects over the past year.

This means the more aTokens the lender holds, the higher the interest fee will be.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"line-height: 140%;\"><strong>Aave’s Flash Loans.</strong> These Loans can be obtained without depositing any collateral and virtually at no cost. Flash Loans rely on loan repayment timing. As long as the loan is borrowed and paid back within the same transaction it was issued, it gets approved. If the loan is not paid back in the same transaction, the loan is canceled.</li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 140%;\"><strong>Aave’s Algorithm.</strong> The protocol’s core mechanism keeps track of the liquidity reserve and collateral price fluctuations. If the value of collateral drops below a threshold, users can get a discounted price as a bonus for liquidating their loans. By working this way, Aave makes sure that the contract pool maintains a certain minimum amount of liquidity.</li>\n<li style=\"line-height: 140%;\"><strong>Aave’s Rate Switching.</strong> This feature offers the flexibility to combine stable and variable rates to achieve the most profitable outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ecosystem has its aTokens for paying interest and LEND tokens granting voting rights for decisions related to the protocol parameters and smart contract upgrades. Back in 2017, Aave&#8217;s ICO campaign raised $600K ETH in exchange for $1B of LEND tokens.</p>\n<h3>ETHLend vs SALT</h3>\n<p>Aave&#8217;s decentralized crypto lending marketplace, ‘ETHLend’ is often compared to centralized loan platforms, like SALT. ETHLend vs SALT is actually a battle of crypto vs fiat collateral. SALT offers fiat-backed loans, which is considered an advantage by those who are used to a more traditional financial system. On the other end, ETHLend offers advantages like no middlemen, independence from banking regulations, and freedom to borrow crypto-backed loans from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Users:</strong> 4,300+</p>\n<p><strong>Total Value Locked:</strong> $50M+</p>\n<p><strong>Token Type:</strong> ETH, WBTC, DAI, USDC, REP, ZRX, TUSD, BUSD, and MANA</p>\n<p><strong>Interest Type:</strong> Floating</p>\n<div class=\"wrapper-logo-icons\"><a href=\"https://aave.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/globe-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"globe-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/aaveaave/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/linkedin-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"linkedin-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/aave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/medium-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"medium-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"github-icon\" /></a></div>\n<h3 id=\"dydx\" style=\"font-size: 25px; font-weight: 400;\">dYdX</h3>\n<div class=\"slide\">\n<p><iframe title=\"dYdX - Derivative &amp; Margin Trading From Your Hardware Wallet\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OujtW5FmcFo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</div>\n<p>The goal of dYdX is to introduce margin trading, options, and derivatives to the blockchain space, which are normally found in fiat markets and common for traditional investments.

Furthermore, 0x enables these DApps to create their own liquidity pools to charge transaction fees on the resulting volume, while swapping tokens.</p>\n<p>0x pulls exchange features from the app layer into the protocol layer and enables easy connection with its API. To top it off, it allows traders to include any kind of asset in a transaction, be it gold, digital asset, or fiat money.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of Users:</strong> 3,300+</p>\n<p><strong>Total Value Locked:</strong> $26M+</p>\n<div class=\"wrapper-logo-icons\"><a href=\"https://0x.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/globe-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"globe-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/0x/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/linkedin-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"linkedin-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.0xproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/medium-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"medium-icon\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"https://github.com/0xProject\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/github-blue-icon.svg\" alt=\"github-icon\" /></a></div>\n<h3 id=\"kyber\" style=\"font-size: 25px; font-weight: 400;\">Kyber</h3>\n<div class=\"slide\">\n<p><iframe title=\"What is Kyber?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf6vPyEzCTI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</div>\n<p>Kyber is another on-chain liquidity protocol offering multiple types of reserves in the form of smart contracts controlled by anyone who deployed it.

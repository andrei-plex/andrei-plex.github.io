For enterprises and organizations, IoT trends manifest themselves through automation, smart supply chain, remote monitoring, and logistics. In the industrial environment, current IoT trends facilitate intelligent manufacturing, smart production, and better customer interaction.</p>\n<p>Read on for more details on the IoT, its history, the recent and future IoT market, and technological trends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-internet-of-things\">What is the Internet of Things?</h2>\n<p>The Internet of Things is an umbrella term that describes a paradigm in which all things can connect to the Internet and transfer data. The &#8220;things&#8221; in the IoT are electromechanical devices that have sensing, actuating, computing, and connectivity capabilities. These devices can act autonomously and share data about their internal states, surrounding environment, and their usage.</p>\n<p>Currently, the Internet of Things architecture is a layered extension of conventional computer networks. The basic building blocks of the <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-iot/\">IoT</a> are things that are connected to the Internet either directly or through gateways, depending on their connectivity capabilities. The things&#8217; capabilities extend to the Cloud. The Cloud is a multi-layered harbor consisting of software suites that implement middleware, host value-added services, perform analytics, and provide the user interface to interact with.</p>\n<p>Cloud middleware, in the scope of IoT, is responsible for ensuring reliable data flow between things and other Cloud services such as management software. Data analytics tools help us discover meaningful patterns in the data collected and can be seen as a building material enabling value-added services. Finally, user interfaces provide a means of interaction with things.</p>\n<p>The most common <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/work/iot/\">IoT applications</a> include consumer-oriented devices (wearables and smart home solutions), connected equipment within enterprises, industrial assets (machines and robots), and connected infrastructure (cities and buildings). IoT applications can operate across heterogeneous domains and enable rich analyses and management of complex interactions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The IoT is removing mundane repetitive tasks or creating things that just weren’t possible before, enabling more people to do more rewarding tasks and leaving the machines to do the repetitive jobs.” — Grant Notman, Head of Sales and Marketing, Wood &amp; Douglas</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-history-of-iot\">The history of IoT</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-history-of-iot.jpg\" alt=\"Three people next to a stopwatch, toaster, and vending machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The prototypes of IoT devices appeared at the outset of the World Wide Web. As one of the first examples, in 1990 John Romkey created an <a href=\"https://blog.avast.com/the-internets-first-smart-device\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Internet-connected toaster</a>. Around the same time, at Carnegie Mellon University, software programmers <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">connected a Coca-Cola vending machine</a> to a network in order to remotely monitor its inventory and environmental conditions. Both of these examples are hardly IoT in the modern sense but serve as historical examples of everyday objects that can communicate through the Internet.</p>\n<p>In 1999, Kevin Ashton coined the term &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; in a presentation he gave at Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G). Ashton linked the new idea of RFID in a supply chain to the Internet. Even though Ashton attracted the interest of P&amp;G executives, the term Internet of Things didn’t get widespread attention for the next ten years.</p>\n<p>In 2005, the UN&#8217;s International Telecommunications Union (ITU) published its first <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/publications/internetofthings/InternetofThings_summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">report</a> on the topic. They described IoT as an entirely new dynamic network of networks, a new dimension in the world of information and communication technologies (ICTs): from anytime and anyplace connectivity for anyone to connectivity for anything.</p>\n<p>According to many IT experts, the Internet of Things market originated between 2008 and 2009. Together with the growth of smartphones and tablet PCs, the number of devices connected to the Internet grew to 12.5 billion in 2010, while the human population increased to 6.8 billion. It was the first time that connected things outnumbered connected people.</p>\n<p>2011 was a significant year in IoT history. IPv6 protocol was launched, ensuring that a large number of IoT devices would be able to connect to the Internet and be uniquely identified. Gartner, the market research company, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/1754719/hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">included the IoT</a> in the hype cycle for emerging technologies. In addition, big companies such as Cisco, IBM, and Ericsson started educational and marketing initiatives on the topic. At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Arduino</a> and similar hardware platforms made IoT accessible to makers and hobbyists.</p>\n<p>The term Internet of Things reached mass-market awareness in January 2014 when Google announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/13/google-nest-labs-3bn-bid-smart-home-devices-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">buying of Nest Labs for US$3.2 billion</a>. This move stimulated the entry of many new businesses into the smart home market. At the time of purchase, Nest marketed a self-learning thermostat that helped reduce household energy bills. Under Google’s guidance Nest became the brand for smart home devices.</p>\n<p>Since then, IoT devices have become common in our everyday lives. Many technology companies now focus their efforts on the development of IoT products and services. In particular, specialized low power wide area networks (LPWANs) were launched to accommodate the development of the IoT such as <a href=\"https://www.i-scoop.eu/internet-of-things-guide/lpwan/nb-iot-narrowband-iot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">NB-IoT</a> by 3GPP and <a href=\"https://www.semtech.com/lora\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">LoRa</a> by Semtech. The world’s largest Cloud providers have launched IoT platforms to help developers bring a huge number of devices online. Among them, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">AWS IoT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/internet-of-things\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">IBM Watson IoT</a>, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Microsoft Azure IoT</a> are those with the most users. In the past 5 years, the IoT has received wide market adoption and found its place in many industries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"internet-of-things-statistics\">Internet of Things (IoT) statistics</h2>\n<p>The Internet of Things allows people and devices to connect to a wide range of networks, thus enabling connectivity between physical and digital worlds.

According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Statista</a>, and data collected by Forbes, the number of installed IoT devices in 2021 is around 35 billion. It will rise to over 75 billion in the next five years (in every second of the next five years, 285 new devices will go online).</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/iot-signals/IoT-Signals-Microsoft-072019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Microsoft</a> market research, around 94% of businesses will use some form of IoT by the end of 2021 with <a href=\"https://dataprot.net/statistics/iot-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">58% of manufacturers</a> viewing IoT as a strategic necessity. Core IoT industries such as manufacturing, retail, transportation, government and healthcare continue to introduce new IoT applications and solutions to their daily operations. Among current IoT business adopters, 88% believe IoT is critical to their business success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"iot-risks-and-challenges-and-covid-19-influence\">IoT risks and challenges and COVID-19 influence</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/iot-risks-and-challenges-and-covid-19-influence.jpg\" alt=\"A medical worker on a tablet screen carrying a shield next to virus models\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Alongside its promise and opportunities for success, its challenges, combined with recent global changes caused by COVID-19, will dictate IoT market trends.</p>\n<p>For both the organizations trying to get IoT projects off the ground and those that are looking to use IoT more, the challenges are complexity and technical hurdles, security concerns, budget and staff resources, and regulatory issues.</p>\n<h3>Technical challenges</h3>\n<p>The diversity of devices, networks, and cloud technology offerings introduces complexity and creates compatibility issues. For example, Bluetooth has long been the compatibility standard for in-home mesh networks. However, competing protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and EnOcean have similar value offerings. It will take a while for the market to settle enough to establish a universal standard for home IoT.</p>\n<p>As the size of the IoT market grows exponentially, bandwidth-intensive IoT applications such as video streaming will soon struggle. Technologies such as edge computing and decentralized networks will serve as a solution to this challenge. But these technologies also bring their own complexities.</p>\n<h3>Security challenges</h3>\n<p>Security is a universal challenge in IoT because the devices increase the number of areas for potential cyber-attackers to penetrate a secure network.</p>\n<p>Attackers most often explore the security vulnerabilities found in the IoT devices. One of the top security priorities is software and firmware management. This area has proved vulnerable in the past due to the inadequacy of encryption protocols (<a href=\"https://financesonline.com/iot-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">98%</a> of all IoT device traffic is unencrypted), hardware and software testing tools, and the updating of software and firmware. Additionally, many IoT devices still operate with default passwords and unpatched software.</p>\n<p>Much of the security responsibilities lie with the IoT device owners. Many users don&#8217;t see IoT devices as potential threats that need to operate updated software and be protected the same way our smartphones and computers do.</p>\n<h3>Resource challenges</h3>\n<p>Over the past several years, many businesses undertook proof of concept (POC) projects in IoT that demonstrated the technology well. However, many companies still lack IoT-related business cases that effectively demonstrate measurable value. This shift from PoC to proof of value through projects will allow businesses to see whether an IoT use case can decrease costs or increase revenue. Such projects require both budgetary and people resources.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft&#8217;s research mentioned above, IoT adopters report that one-third of IoT projects fail in proof of concept (POC), often because the implementation is expensive or the bottom-line benefits are unclear. Many organizations reported that their projects failed because their pilots demonstrated uncertain business value or ROI and it is also difficult to justify a business case without short-term impact.</p>\n<h3>Regulatory challenges</h3>\n<p>As with any other technological innovation, government regulations often require time to catch up with the state of play. The rapid evolution of the IoT poses regulatory challenges for both organizations and customers. The absence of strong IoT regulation is a primary reason for the IoT remaining a severe security risk.</p>\n<p>In medical, banking, insurance, infrastructure, manufacturing and pharmaceutical applications, the lack of sufficient regulation imposes an additional cost associated with bringing products to market.</p>\n<p>Quality control in IoT is difficult due to large numbers of IoT devices now being imported from under-regulated markets that have different standards.</p>\n<h3>COVID-19 challenges</h3>\n<p>IoT has huge potential to help countries minimize the effects of COVID-19. The wide range of IoT applications can ensure that health and safety guidelines are in place. At the same time, IoT has a scalable network that can handle a large amount of crucial data from sensors used by applications fighting COVID-19.</p>\n<p>In a time of the pandemic, communications and medical applications drive IoT developments. Virtualized health services play an essential role in easing patient treatment demands. Remote patient monitoring and telehealth services will drive IoT market investment. Now more than ever, IoT security is gaining in importance as highly sensitive medical equipment, as well as healthcare data, needs to be protected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.orange-business.com/en/blogs/iot-hong-kong-new-use-cases-helping-make-covid-19-recovery-safer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Hong Kong</a> already uses IoT to lessen the spread of COVID-19. The authorities deployed GPS-enabled applications to track people’s movements in accordance with quarantine protocols. In addition, IoT-based thermal detectors were installed in public places, like shops and offices, to single out people with abnormal body temperature.</p>\n<p>With the pandemic-induced economic slowdown, business and technology leaders need to view the IoT as one of many tools in a toolbox and learn how to use it in conjunction with other equally essential tools like analytics, to drive value from it. Such endeavors will require some re-education of the workforce.</p>\n<h2 id=\"top-iot-application-industries-in-2020-and-beyond\">Top IoT application industries in 2021 and beyond</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/top-iot-application-industries-in-2021-and-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"Three people using devices to communicate on city background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Business owners and governments utilize the IoT to drive process efficiencies, save money, and create better user experiences.

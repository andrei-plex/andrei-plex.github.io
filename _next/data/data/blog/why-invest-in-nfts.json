Below we will take a closer look at some of them to see what makes NFTs so valuable and special.</p>\n<h3>NFTs boast a number of use cases</h3>\n<p>NFTs are versatile and applicable to different domains.</p>\n<p>Despite their novelty, NFTs already boast several use cases. So, for instance, NFTs can be employed to represent invention patents and serve as access to different events.</p>\n<p>What is more, NFTs have made inroads in logistics and supply chain: they can be assigned to goods or other unique items to track their journey to the end consumer.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check out top ten NFT projects and use cases across different industries","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/top-ten-nft-projects/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>NFTs allow you to own something unique</h3>\n<p>First of all, the most distinct feature of non-fungible tokens is that they provide their holders with an opportunity to become the sole owner of the desired digital item. This might be a digital image, an audio clip, a video fragment or meme, etc.</p>\n<p>Chiefly, thanks to the specific functionality of blockchain and advanced <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/smart-contract-development-audit/\">smart contracts</a> that underpin NFTs, these digital assets come with public proof of ownership and are immune to replication.</p>\n<h3>NFTs serve as the facilitators of the creator economy</h3>\n<p>If you have not heard about the term “creator economy” — now is the time to bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>The creator economy allows content creators, such as bloggers, influencers, TikTokers, and so on to generate revenue from their creations. As of now, there are about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/12/29/why-the-creator-economy-is-worth-watching-in-2022/?sh=4fcab998583c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50 million</a> independent content creators around the world and the number is growing by leaps and bounds.</p>\n<p>As for the role of NFTs in the creator economy, it is important to highlight that non-fungible tokens help democratize content creation as well as make it possible for digital innovators to monetize their works by converting them into profitable digital assets that can be sold in the form of NFTs to eager devotees and enthusiasts.</p>\n<h3>NFTs can help diversify your portfolio</h3>\n<p>If you are a crypto investor, you should know that you will have a greater chance of making a substantial profit if you invest in several different coins and tokens.</p>\n<p>NFTs, for their part, have the ability to contribute to the diversification of your financial portfolio. However, if you are a beginner in the NFT space, you should initially experiment with a couple of NFT campaigns to properly assess their viability and examine which NFT category to invest in further.</p>\n<h3>NFTs bring about greater market efficiency</h3>\n<p>Another prominent advantage of NFTs is that they empower digital creators to directly engage with their target audiences. This means that artists will no longer need to resort to agents and physical galleries to assist them in reaching out to customers.</p>\n<p>In the long run, this can help drastically speed up processes, cut down costs, and contribute to the smooth communication flow between NFT creators and buyers.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Find out which blockchain will be a perfect fit for your NFT project","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/top-ten-blockchains-for-nft-development/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"should-you-invest-in-nfts\">Should you invest in NFTs after all?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/is-it-a-good-idea-to-invest-in-nfts-after-all.jpg\" alt=\"A person investing in NFT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>It is quite challenging to provide a direct answer to the question since opinions regarding NFT feasibility are split.</p>\n<p>However, there is one thing no one can cast doubt on: the NFT market is attracting more and more participants which consequently means that the demand for NFTs is growing too. Now let’s delve into the chief reasons why you can start thinking about investing in NFTs.</p>\n<h3>Ample monetization opportunities</h3>\n<p>At the moment, NFTs offer a gamut of monetization opportunities. For example, you can choose to <strong>invest in an NFT token itself</strong> or <strong>consider other viable options</strong>, such as an NFT marketplace or <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-gamefi/\">GameFi</a> and <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-metaverse/\">metaverse</a> platforms and projects that are reliant on NFTs.</p>\n<p>Notably, the popularity of <strong>custom NFT platform development</strong> has been on the rise. Lots of NFT fans and entrepreneurs are bringing forward ground-breaking ideas and are willing to develop their own NFT platforms focusing on particular NFT categories.</p>\n<p>With an NFT platform tailored in accordance with your requirements, you can not only generate revenue but also establish a global presence and have a competitive edge over other NFT investors.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Discover how to create your own NFT platform","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/how-to-create-nft-marketplace/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>Access to the global market</h3>\n<p>Another significant aspect of NFT investment in general is that this niche is open to literally everyone, regardless of their financial status and previous investment experience.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, the majority of all existing NFTs cost <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/think-artists-are-getting-rich-off-nfts-think-again-1962752\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">around $200</a> or even less.

They may suffer from multiple vulnerabilities, including smart contract issues, marketplace and NFT security risks, cybersecurity problems, and NFT fraud.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, fake NFTs remain the most pressing concern in the entire space. As a result many NFT adopters are afraid of wasting their money on a fake work and give up on the whole idea.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there are viable solutions to this problem, with <a href=\"https://checknft.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CheckNFT</a> being one of them.

Decide which one best coincides with your preferences and try to examine whether its value has the potential to increase over time (i.e. whether it will help you generate revenue if you decide to trade it).</p>\n<p><strong>Step two — review NFT marketplaces</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have determined your NFT category, explore the available NFT platforms and/or check out whether it can be obtained on specialized NFT marketplaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Step three — create a crypto wallet</strong></p>\n<p>To operate and trade on the marketplace, you will have to set up a crypto wallet which will be used for sending, receiving, and safely storing your NFTs.</p>\n<p>When you have completed these steps, you are finally ready to purchase your NFT and become the lucky owner of a unique gem.</p>\n<p><strong>Step four — monitor changes on the NFT market</strong></p>\n<p>As time goes by, you might want to re-sell your digital asset at a higher price. Keep a watchful eye on the latest news and trends occurring in the NFT space and react to them accordingly. Probably, you have invested in a highly prospective NFT whose value will go up at lightning speed. In this way, you can resell it and yield substantial profits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-of-nfts\">What does the future of NFTs look like?</h2>\n<p>To invest or not to invest in NFTs remains a frequently asked question these days.</p>\n<p>Even though there is a lot of skepticism regarding the feasibility of NFTs, one thing is certain: <strong>NFTs are here to stay</strong>.</p>\n<p>Essentially, if done in the right manner and with a good understanding of how they work, non-fungible tokens can offer a sea of opportunities to their holders as well as help bring revenue.

The only thing they need is a stable internet connection.</p>\n<p>Notably, technological advances such as text-to-speech and speech-to-text manage to eliminate the barriers for students with disabilities, thus enabling quite literally anyone to join the educational process.</p>\n<h3>Personalized learning</h3>\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://tomorrow.org/Speakup/speakup2018-19-Digital-Learning-Peril-or-Promise-october2019.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">59% of middle school students</a> admit that digital educational tools have helped them to raise their grades and test scores.</p>\n<p>By making use of digital technologies, students can learn new material at their own pace and adapt the lessons to their own preferences and cognitive skill sets.</p>\n<p>In addition, specialized learning experience platforms give students the ability to combine learning materials from different sources and enjoy more personalized experiences.</p>\n<h3>Greater engagement</h3>\n<p>Teachers, for their part, can offer students more engaging ways of learning and absorbing new material. Interactive whiteboards, tablets, smart classes, projectors, chatbots, AR/VR, and AI-powered software will boost learning performance and save time on various managerial tasks.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, teachers can also create and manage groups in a digital cooperative setting via learning platforms so that students can effectively exchange information, participate in discussions, and answer teachers’ questions.</p>\n<h3>Improved safety and protection</h3>\n<p>By integrating IoT-enabled sensors, CCTV systems, IP cameras, and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to help maintain the safety and well-being of both educators and students.</p>\n<p>Face recognition capabilities can allow for sophisticated tracking of an establishment’s facilities, detecting suspicious people and/or activities.</p>\n<p>Besides, novelties such as face mask detection and social distancing control systems as well as thermal screening will spot someone who is running a temperature or not keeping their distance and will issue an appropriate alert.</p>\n<h3>Clearer picture of student performance</h3>\n<p>A good deal of <a href=\"https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/what-research-says-about-parent-involvement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research</a> has shown that parental involvement is crucial to children’s successful performance at school. Technology, for its part, provides parents with more sophisticated ways of tracking kids’ progress. These days there exist a number of tools and systems that automatically send parents progress and attendance reports on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>But technology can go one step further: through making use of big data and analyzing students’ overall performance, strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, a student can receive a comprehensive career guide, telling them which potential occupations will suit their interests and capabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges-and-limitations-of-digital-transformation-in-education\">Challenges and limitations of digital transformation in education</h2>\n<p>Despite its multiple benefits, digital transformation in education does not come easy. There are certain obstacles, including a faulty long-term strategy, unwillingness to change, and lack of relevant skills that create barriers to a smooth transition from traditional methods of teaching and learning to more advanced ones.</p>\n<h3>Poorly defined long-term strategy</h3>\n<p>Once an educational establishment has decided to go digital but does not have a thorough step-by-step plan, it can face a lot of challenges and roadblocks.</p>\n<p>As a rule, digital transformation starts with planning and drawing up an exhaustive, forward-looking strategy that foresees all eventualities and answers the chief questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What are you and your educational establishment planning to achieve with digital tools?</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Does the existing legacy system allow you to successfully incorporate new digital technologies?</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Are teachers and students adequately trained and prepared to embrace the change?</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Will everyone have equal access to new models of learning?</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Do you have the infrastructure budget needed to bring about changes, customizations, and replacements?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unwillingness to change</h3>\n<p>Some educational establishments may find it difficult to alter the way they manage their internal processes as they might not be very willing to leave their comfort zone. Some educators may be used to their status quo and even fear that technology will replace them.</p>\n<p>The point here is to persuade teachers that even the most sophisticated tech will never replace them — rather, it will help ease the burden of preparing materials and activities for their classes and make lessons more engaging and informative.</p>\n<h3>Insufficient tech knowledge and skills</h3>\n<p>The demand for tech-savvy professors is growing, and it is expected that around <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/summer2019/pages/the-u.s.-needs-to-prepare-workers-for-stem-jobs.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.5 million STEM jobs</a> will need to be filled by 2025. Yet analysis, worryingly, suggests that millions (!) of these positions will remain vacant because not enough educators have relevant digital skills and knowledge.</p>\n<p>The digital transformation of educational processes will not come off until educators have a thorough understanding of how to leverage digital tools and solutions in teaching and learning activities.</p>\n<p>Therefore, teaching staff need to be regularly trained and updated with the digital skills that will allow them to educate, monitor, and motivate their students. Meanwhile, students too should be constantly helped to hone their digital skills.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technologies-that-enable-digital-transformation-in-education\">Technologies that enable digital transformation in education</h2>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/technologies-that-enable-digital-transformation-in-education.jpg\" alt=\"A person reading a book next to an android\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Given the increasing popularity of digital tools, the educational technology market is projected to expand to <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/global-education-technology-market-to-reach-341b-by-2025-1027892295\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$342 billion</a> by 2025.</p>\n<p>Below we will look at the most profound tech trends such as artificial intelligence, chatbots, AR/VR, the metaverse, blockchain, and IoT, as well as their related use cases, and see how they can benefit the entire education sector.</p>\n<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has made inroads into a wide range of educational processes, and it is expected that the global use of AI in education will hit <a href=\"https://www.marketresearchengine.com/artificial-intelligence-in-education-market?mod=article_inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$5.8 billion</a> by 2025.</p>\n<p>The sophisticated technology has been successfully leveraged to overhaul the way teachers do their job and students acquire new learning materials.</p>\n<p>AI contributes enormously to the promotion of personalized learning by enabling students to make the most of adaptive learning software and different gamification techniques. It also has the capacity to highlight the areas that a student is not so good at and the topics they still need to master.</p>\n<p>What’s more, multiple AI-based tutoring programs such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thirdspacetweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Third Space Learning</a> have already been successfully launched. They support students in learning the ropes of mathematics and writing (among other subjects), though they lack high-order thinking skills and creativity.</p>\n<p>Another point worth mentioning is that AI can give teachers a leg up in automating grading for multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank tests. This allows educators to focus on activities that require creativity and personal interaction with students.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"See how our industry-certified AI engineers can help address your business hurdles","url":"https://pixelplex.io/artificial-intelligence/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>Chatbots</h3>\n<p><a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/chatbot-development/\">AI-enabled chatbots</a> have become a go-to tool in the education sector, proving a hit not only with teachers and students but also with administrative staff.</p>\n<p>Chatbot technologies perform a wide variety of tasks extremely capably and around the clock. Among the most popular issues they can deal with are answering routine questions, providing feedback to learners, assisting with undergraduate applicants, and counseling potential students on the admission process.</p>\n<p>At present, a large number of universities across the globe, including <a href=\"https://www.itnews.com.au/news/deakins-genie-assistant-tackles-12000-conversations-a-day-530688\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deakin University</a> in Australia and Georgia State University are actively implementing AI chatbots into their processes. As well as this, outstanding corporations such as IBM, Amazon, and Drift have expressed avid interest in chatbot technology too and developed their own solutions that can be customized to address different educational aspects.</p>\n<h3>AR/VR</h3>\n<p><a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/augmented-virtual-reality/\">AR/VR</a> in the education market is projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/virtual-classroom-market-203811025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$19.6 billion</a> by 2023. They represent by far the most outstanding technologies that can be applied to a variety of educational activities.</p>\n<p>AR/VR are widely regarded as valuable additions to the education scene because they offer extraordinary immersive experiences such as the ability to present information in advanced and captivating ways, and the potential to extend access to educational opportunities.</p>\n<p>With high-performing AR/VR solutions, students are able to easily interact with virtual objects and their surroundings as well as other individuals. To date, plenty of AR/VR initiatives have been launched to assist students. For instance, there is the solution by Merge Cube that helps transform visual objects into 3D tactile items, or <a href=\"https://www.tcu360.com/2022/01/holoanatomy-a-virtual-view-of-the-human-body/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HoloAnatomy</a> which enables medical students to have a better understanding of the human body using AR simulations.</p>\n<p>AR/VR can also serve as a time machine, transporting students to different eras so that they can have a clearer sense of the most important world events. There are also VR initiatives like <a href=\"https://www.thevrara.com/blog2/2021/7/6/virtual-reality-helps-students-build-skills-for-the-modern-workplace-bodyswapsvr-ufitrust-southessexcoll-harlowcollege-writtleofficial-sandwellcollege-bridgendcollege\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bodyswaps</a> that are aimed at helping students to practice job interviews and hone their soft skills.</p>\n<p>In addition, AR/VR tools help teachers build 3D versions of classrooms where each student is represented as an avatar that can move around the classroom and interact with classmates. These virtual classes usually have a language translation function, meaning that the problem of language barriers can finally be solved.</p>\n<p>Another prominent advantage of AR/VR in education is that the technology can cater to the needs of learners with disabilities. With these tools it is now possible to design sophisticated immersive environments that will enable students to change color contrast or font size, or to add an audio commentary.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"In this article we have covered the full gamut of AR/VR applications and use cases in education.

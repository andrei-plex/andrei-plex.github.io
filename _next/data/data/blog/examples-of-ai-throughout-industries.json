Modern AI models and algorithms are based on the concepts of artificial neural networks that mimic our brain’s functions. These models allow AI solutions to take part in the process of data acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making.</p>\n<p>AI technology enhances human capabilities, and many businesses have tapped into this resource to increase their efficiency and minimize costs. They are using these new capabilities to improve their products and provide better services. Read on to learn more about AI and its top applications throughout industries.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai-and-its-types\">Artificial intelligence and its types</h2>\n<p>There are various types of Artificial Intelligence, however, the two main classifications are based on its functionality and its capabilities.</p>\n<p>AI types based on capabilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)</strong> is designed to perform a single task or a set of related activities. For instance, this could be analyzing images, searching through large chunks of information to find some insights, speech recognition, or providing recommendations. Almost all AI-systems, as of today, can be classified under this type. Apple&#8217;s Siri virtual assistant or Netflix video recommendations are good examples of ANI.</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial general intelligence (AGI)</strong> is a level of AI that can perform intellectual and creative tasks with human-like capabilities. It is supposed to make informed decisions based on previous experience and knowledge in related areas. Although there have been some attempts, this type of AI has not yet been fully developed.</li>\n<li><strong>Artificial superintelligence (ASI)</strong> is meant to surpass human abilities in analytical thinking, creativity, and performance of completing tasks. We are still a long way from implementing these types of computer systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the functionality, the major subfields of AI are described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> is the development of an algorithm that can discover patterns and learn from previous data without explicit programming. ML is divided into four main learning approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>\n<p>In supervised learning, the algorithm is required to provide answers based on an approved set of information. This type of model is trained using labeled data. With unsupervised learning, the model is trained using unlabeled data that the algorithm must classify and create groups with similar values. The trained model is then used to identify the group that the particular object or value belongs to.</p>\n<p>In semi-supervised learning: the reference data used to train the model is incomplete. It uses supervised learning to train from the available labeled data set and unsupervised learning to complete the gaps. Reinforcement Learning is used to train AI systems based on rewards and penalties for the task that the model performs. It’s up to the model, through trial and error, to figure out a pattern that leads to maximum rewards and the least amount of penalties.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep learning (DL)</strong> uses a broader set of machine learning techniques to work with large arrays of unlabeled data. This data is run through multiple layers of a neural network to categorize and classify data and make predictions. DL is widely used in self-driving cars, image processing and recognition, language processing, and other complex tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong> is the development of computer systems capable of processing human language. The inputted text or audio is translated to a format which the machine understands. The model is trained based on the meaning of certain words, phrases, and lexical constructs that connect them together. For instance, Siri is instructed through speech or text.</p>\n<p><strong>Computer vision</strong> algorithms are used to recognize objects in images and videos. The model is trained by feeding it a large set of images of an object that needs to be identified. It analyzes images by finding the edges and subcomponents of the object and that way learns what it looks like.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai-app-in-industries\">Artificial intelligence application in industries</h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has found its way into many industries out of the need for businesses to automate mundane tasks, as well as to increase the productivity in crucial processes that require working with large sets of information and making precise calculations. Learn about some of <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/future-ai-applications-benefits-impact-on-business/\">AI’s real-life applications</a> from the examples below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ai-in-healthcare\">AI in healthcare</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ai-in-healthcare.jpg\" alt=\"A scientist in a research laboratory analyzing data with the help of artificial intelligence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>According to a 2021 survey, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1225955/stage-of-ai-adoption-in-healthcare-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">19%</a> of healthcare organizations have already implemented AI tools into their work.

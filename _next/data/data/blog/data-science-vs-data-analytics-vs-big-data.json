And the more digital we become the more data we create. According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2021/12/30/54-predictions-about-the-state-of-data-in-2021/?sh=3f18cc82397d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forbes</a>, the amount of data produced in the world increased from 1.2 trillion gigabytes in 2010 to 59 trillion gigabytes in 2020, growth of almost 5,000%.</p>\n<p>The increasing amount of data produced and consumed worldwide is leading to the development of solutions that are capable of collecting, manipulating, and analyzing it. That’s how we come to such fields as big data, data science, and data analytics. For instance, a report created by <a href=\"https://www.tcs.com/content/dam/tcs-bts/pdf/insights/Big-Data-Executive-Survey-2019-Findings-Updated-010219-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NewVantage Partners</a> states that 97.2% of businesses are investing in big data.</p>\n<p>Read on for explanations of what big data, data analytics, and data science are, to learn their differences, and to find out how each of them deals with data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-data-important\">Why is data important?</h2>\n<p>Data is one of literally any company’s biggest assets. When used effectively, it can help a business make informed decisions, improve customer relationships, and increase revenue. According to global statistics, poor data quality costs companies worldwide up to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/332238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$14.2 million</a> each year. And at the macro level, for those operating in a data-driven economy like the US, this figure can reach trillions.</p>\n<p>To establish a strong business presence, companies not only need to learn how to manage large sums of data but also find out how to use this data to its full potential. In a recent survey, Forbes found out that <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rkulkarni/2019/02/07/big-data-goes-big/?sh=3f390a020d7b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">95% of businesses</a> need to manage unstructured data, 40% of them on a frequent basis. It is estimated that by 2025, more than 150 trillion gigabytes of data will need to be analyzed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately this leads to a global demand for data science, data analytics, and big data services, all of which are aimed at helping businesses manage their data and receive actionable insights.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-data-science\">What is data science?</h2>\n<p>Data science is a broad concept, which presupposes gathering data from multiple sources and extracting critical information with the help of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis. Basically, its major goal is to provide businesses with <strong>accurate predictions and insights</strong>, thus enabling companies to confidently make critical business decisions.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-data-science.jpg\" alt=\"Data science explanation infographic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The data science process generally includes these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Formulating research questions</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Collecting data from multiple disparate sources</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Preprocessing and cleansing raw data to make it ready for analysis</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Designing AI and ML models to mine big data sets</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Developing tools to track and analyze data accuracy</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Building data visualization tools such as dashboards, charts, and reports</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Implementing programs to automate data collection and processing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the most obvious examples of a data science application is the Google search engine, which applies data science algorithms to deliver the best results to search queries in just seconds.</p>\n<p>However, there are many more applications for data science, including making healthcare predictions, analyzing customer behavior, receiving financial recommendations, or optimizing supply chains.</p>\n<p>For example, United Parcel Service, a multinational shipping and supply chain management company, has an integrated navigation system called <a href=\"https://about.ups.com/ae/en/newsroom/press-releases/innovation-driven/ups-to-enhance-orion-with-continuous-delivery-route-optimization.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ORION</a>. The solution applies data science algorithms, artificial intelligence and machine learning to help drivers choose over 66,000 fuel-efficient routes.

Let&#8217;s figure out what their differences are through a data science vs machine learning comparison.</p>\n<h3>What are the differences between data science and machine learning?</h3>\n<p>The main distinction between data science and machine learning is that <strong>machine learning is one of the techniques of data science</strong>. Machine learning uses algorithms to extract data, learn from it, and make predictions. Data science, in contrast, is a much wider concept as it encompasses data engineering, data analytics, machine learning, predictive analytics, and more.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-are-the-differences-between-data-science-and-machine-learning.jpg\" alt=\"Data science vs machine learning infographic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /><br />\nData analysts have created a whole set of ML models for different use cases.

The platform applies ML algorithms to identify user patterns and recommend interesting posts on users’ news feeds. Similarly, Netflix leverages ML and AI algorithms to advise users on movies and shows based on their watching history. According to <a href=\"https://thinkml.ai/intelligence-on-netflix-how-netflix-is-using-ai-and-bigdata/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aish Fenton</a>, software engineer at Netflix,</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“80% of what people played on Netflix came from the recommendation algorithm.”</em></p></blockquote>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Meet CheckNFT.iO – an intelligent solution that uses data science and ML algorithms to identify fraud and analyze the value of non-fungible tokens","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/intelligent-nft-analysis-platform/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h2 id=\"what-is-data-analytics\">What is data analytics?</h2>\n<p>Data analytics involves analyzing large amounts of data with the help of specialized software and algorithms to answer questions and draw conclusions.</p>\n<p>Many businesses collect huge amounts of data all the time. Yet, in its raw form, this data doesn’t mean anything. And this is where data analytics come into play, helping analyze raw data and get actionable insights.</p>\n<p>The data analytics process generally includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Identifying informational needs</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Acquiring data from primary and secondary sources</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cleansing data for analysis</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Analyzing data to spot patterns and translate them into insights</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Presenting findings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also four main types of data analytics. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Descriptive analytics:</strong> aims to understand, evaluate, and describe something that has already happened.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Diagnostic analytics:</strong> seeks to understand the “why” behind what has happened.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Predictive analytics:</strong> relies on historical data and past trends to answer the question about what should happen in the future.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Prescriptive analytics:</strong> tries to identify specific actions that a business should make to achieve its goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both data science and analytics work with large sets of data and aim to help businesses make informed decisions, which is why they can easily be confused.</p>\n<h3>What is the difference between data analytics and data science?</h3>\n<p>The key difference between data analytics and data science is that data analytics mainly works with structured historical data to extract relevant patterns and conclusions, while data science mostly works with unstructured data and deals with trends and predictions.</p>\n<p>So while data analytics helps convert a large number of figures in the form of data and present it in a simple format, data science is a broader term. It includes data analytics and uses more advanced techniques like machine learning models or predictive algorithms to explore new issues and solve analytically complex business problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-big-data\">What is big data?</h2>\n<p>Big data is a field that analyzes significant volumes of data that cannot be processed with traditional software. These volumes include unstructured (social networks, blogs, video files), semi-structured (text files, system log files), and structured data (databases, transaction data).</p>\n<p>Big data leverages specialized hardware, software, processing techniques, and database technologies. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/big-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gartner</a>,</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>As you might guess, big data and data science are other groups of terms that are commonly compared.</p>\n<p>So, is data science the same as big data? Long story short, they are not the same terms. Big data may be considered a pool of data that has no value until it is analyzed. It is used for processing significant amounts of data. However, to utilize this data to extract valuable information a company would need data science.</p>\n<p>To understand the differences between big data and data science, let’s take a look at the steps involved in processing big data. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Architecting distributed systems for collecting data and ensuring their scalability and security</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Building a large-scale data processing system to store and process huge amounts of data</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Processing the data using big data tools (Hadoop, Cassandra, Stats iQ)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"data-science-vs-data-analytics-vs-big-data\">Data science vs data analytics vs big data: what are their differences?</h2>\n<p>Now that we’ve got a basic understanding of data science, data analytics, and big data, let’s try to compare the three and identify their key differences. In the most basic words:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Big data</strong> is a field that includes collecting and processing huge amounts of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Data science</strong> is a broad term that encompasses data analytics, ML, AI, and other algorithms to process structured and unstructured data, extract meaningful insights and predict future trends</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Data analytics</strong> works mostly with structured historical data to identify patterns and translate them into insights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, let’s proceed with a more detailed comparison of the three fields, paying attention to their characteristics, how they work with data, their goals, and their business applications.</p>\n<p>And if you’re among those users who are not keen on long reads, you may simply scan the data science vs big data vs data analytics infographic below.

So there’s a need for <strong>big data</strong> specialists who can evaluate massive amounts of unstructured data by creating a specific environment using various big data tools and technologies.</p>\n<p>Then <strong>data scientists </strong>come into play. They evaluate how users interact with Netflix and analyze the impact of the quality of information (e.g., picture quality) on user behavior. Using ML models, they identify the types of content a user is likely to watch. With this data at hand, data scientists can help Netflix create personalized streaming experiences, optimize content caching, and improve the entire service.</p>\n<p><strong>Data analysts</strong> can assist data science in evaluating user behavior. For example, we have 50 different users, each of them with their own specific video preferences. Data analysts can create a personalized profile for each of these users. Data analysts can also create trending video lists as well as sorting a user’s recently watched videos and estimating whether they will continue to watch or stop watching a specific movie or show.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-choose-which-one\">When to choose which one?</h2>\n<p>Whether we are talking about big data, data science, or data analytics, each of these tools is aimed at dealing with data to provide a business with useful insights and recommendations. In fact, quite often they are interconnected.</p>\n<p>For example, big data is characterized by its volume, variety, and velocity while data science provides tools and techniques to analyze these large sets of data. It is often used for digging into insights provided by big data.</p>\n<p>Data analytics will be useful for companies that have specific questions and want to find answers based on historical data. And data science will be helpful for organizations that want to optimize existing workflows, predict trends and receive unique insights about the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts</h2>\n<p>In this digital era, the amount of data, both structured and unstructured, is increasing each day. If companies want to stay competitive in the market, it is crucial for them to manage their data effectively.</p>\n<p>Big data, data science, and analytics have proved to be efficient tools which help companies identify inefficiencies, personalize their service delivery, optimize workflows, and minimize risk.</p>\n<p>If you want to use your business data to its full potential and get actionable insights, you are welcome to visit our <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/big-data-consulting/\">big data consulting</a> page and send us your query using the contact form.

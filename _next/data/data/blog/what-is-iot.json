This smart device was able to report its inventory along with the temperature of the sodas from a distance.</p>\n<p>In 1991, Mark Weiser, a computer scientist, expressed the contemporary vision of the IoT in his paper on ubiquitous computing, “The Computer of the 21st Century”. Reza Raji, an internet of things veteran, was the first to demonstrate moving small segments of data to a large set of nodes that could help integrate and automate machines in homes or factories. He described his work as IEEE Spectrum.</p>\n<p>The period between 1993 and 1997 saw several companies come forward with their ideation of the IoT. It came into the spotlight when William Nelson Joy (Bill Joy), an American computer engineer, proposed device-to-device communication as a part of his “Six Webs” framework. He showcased his work at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.</p>\n<p>During the same year, the phrase “internet of things” was coined by Kevin Ashton of Procter &amp; Gamble. He also described how indispensable Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags fit into the IoT environment and how they can be used to track the location of equipment. RFID also allowed using computers to manage processes and streamline the workflow.</p>\n<p>The IoT first came to the attention of businesses and manufacturers, and its applications were called machine-to-machine (M2M). But it soon found its way into offices and homes with smart devices such as televisions, speakers, and household appliances being connected, remodeling styles of working and living. A colorful example is the Nest thermostat that allowed customers to adjust the temperature of their home from their smartphones.</p>\n<h2>How big is the internet of things?</h2>\n<p>The growth of the IoT has been witnessed by tech analysts all over the world. International Data Corporation (IDC) has estimated, based on the growth of the IoT in recent years, that there will be 55.7 billion devices connected to the IoT by 2025. Industries leading the race to connect devices to the IoT are industrial and automotive, with smart homes and wearable devices coming close.</p>\n<p>The rapid growth of the IoT landscape is predicted in various sectors such as enterprise, security devices, automotive, and healthcare. Currently a hundred billion dollar market, it’s expected to grow to over a trillion dollars in just a few years.

However, there are several IoT security issues that cannot be ignored and need serious attention. Hackers have a knack for finding loopholes and exploiting vulnerabilities in environments where data exchange is prevalent. They attack the apps, the gateways, data centers, the devices themselves, and more.</p>\n<p>What’s worrisome is that some devices may have malware on them before you even get them. Once they’re installed, they corrupt the connected network and put its entire security at stake. Here are some potentially exploitable weak spots of IoT security:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unpatched vulnerabilities.</strong> Sometimes there’s a connectivity issue in the devices forcing users to manually update and set the devices. This increases the chance of getting attacked due to outdated software. Hackers are quick at discovering back doors in older software and exploiting users this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Exploitable APIs.</strong> APIs are a gateway to command and control centers. There are cases of APIs being routinely attacked with a variety of penetration methods.</li>\n<li><strong>Weak authentication.</strong> Devices with security passwords and no other factors of authentication are often easy targets for hackers. If the password is not timely updated, it may be vulnerable to unwanted remote access.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Privacy in the internet of things</h2>\n<p>Apart from security issues, consumers are very much concerned about privacy. IoT devices now know your daily schedule better than yourself, like when you wake up, brush your teeth, have coffee, leave home, and more. The question of who has access to this data, other than you, is a matter of concern. According to reports, a lot can be known about a person by simply gaining access to the data in IoT devices, and this is quite alarming.</p>\n<p>Let’s brush through a list of some of the major IoT privacy issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unprotected data flows</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The amount of data that IoT devices generate can be disturbing. Some reports show that households within just one city generate hundreds of millions of discrete data points on a daily basis. Without any protective measures, the result is more entry points for hackers and sensitive information being left out in the open.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Undisclosed personal information</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Companies could obtain access to personal data when customers agree to the terms and conditions for the provision of services. For instance, an insurance company can get access to information about your driving habits using a connected car when calculating your insurance rate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eavesdropping</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invading homes virtually can be easily done by manufacturers or hackers using a connected device. A German researcher demonstrated this by intercepting unencrypted data from a smart device to reveal what television show someone was watching at that moment.</p>\n<p>Each of these problems could hamper consumers&#8217; desire to go ahead and purchase connected products. This would prevent the IoT from fulfilling its true potential.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-internet-of-things-and-data\">The internet of things and data</h2>\n<p>The IoT generates a vast amount of data that comes in various forms such as videos, voice requests, temperature readings and others. This growing source of IoT metadata needs to be managed and fed into NoSQL databases to bring onboard structure to unstructured content. Further, analytical systems create new levels of understanding and provide the insights needed to improve our digital environments.</p>\n<p>How does the internet of things collect this data? Let us explain it to you.</p>\n<p>An IoT device contains one or more sensors to collect data. Different sensors have different roles depending on their usage. For instance, sensors inside industrial machines are used to measure temperature, a security camera might have a proximity sensor, and your home weather station probably has a humidity sensor. All this sensor data is transmitted through Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G, and more.</p>\n<p>There are different types of data that these sensors collect. Here’s a breakdown of the types of sensor data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Status data</strong> is the most basic type of information gathered. For example, whether an appliance is off or on, whether there are available spots at a property, and more. This data is used for decision-making, planning, and maintenance.</li>\n<li><strong>Location data</strong> tracks the movement of an object or a person. Connected devices make use of location data for fleet management, asset tracking, employee monitoring, shipment tracking, and other management tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Automation data</strong> lets IoT systems take control of devices inside a house, vehicles on the road, and other moving parts of any system. Leveraging automation data is a complex process due to the high chance of errors like accidental lockdown or traffic accidents. Nevertheless, with security practices, a large number of IoT systems will depend on automation data.</li>\n<li><strong>Actionable data</strong> is an addition to status data. The device captures information,  processes it, and transforms it into easy-to-carry-out instructions. It is often used in forecasting and prediction, energy consumption, and workplace efficiency optimization. It can also be used in long-term decision-making.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"iot-in-the-context-of-edge-computing-and-the-cloud\">IoT in the context of edge computing and the cloud</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://pixelplex.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iot-in-the-context-of-edge-computing-and-the-cloud.jpg\" alt=\"Two people connected to the devices via cloud technologies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Edge computing is based on appliances placed close to <a href=\"https://pixelplex.io/blog/top-iot-apps-and-device-examples/\">IoT devices</a> managing the flow of data from those devices and making basic assessments of this data on the spot. Once the data is processed, it goes to a centralized data center, or even more often it will end up in the cloud. The elastic nature of cloud computing is suitable for IoT machines where data is segmented or sent irregularly.</p>\n<p>Organizations often incorporate a combination of both edge computing and cloud. Cloud computing is mostly used for the storage and execution of applications and processes. Edge computing, on the other hand, is used particularly when processing confidential data. It handles data faster and more accurately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-5g-fit-into-the-internet-of-things-and-sharing-data\">How does 5G fit into the internet of things and sharing data?</h2>\n<p>IoT devices incorporate various ways of connecting and sharing data depending on the requirements. However, the most common method to connect and share data is through wireless connectivity. Wi-Fi, Zigbee or Bluetooth Low Energy, and Ethernet are used in homes and workplaces. Some IoT devices use LTE or satellite connections for interaction.</p>\n<p>It is argued that the usage of 5G networks would have a positive impact on IoT projects in the near future. Since the 5G network has the resilience to fit as many as one million 5G devices in a square kilometer, it has the potential to increase dataflow and accelerate the generation of insightful analytics.</p>\n<p>Experts suggest that the 5G network will become the underlying fabric of an ecosystem of fully connected smart sensors and objects. 5G is expected to encourage a new style of living and add value for businesses in various ways in the form of manufacturing and connected products, smart cities, connected vehicles, and healthcare.</p>\n<h2 id=\"artificial-intelligence-giving-life-to-iot-data-via-analytics\">Artificial intelligence giving life to IoT data via analytics</h2>\n<p>It’s no wonder that companies are relying on artificial intelligence to manage data that comes from billions of internet of things devices. With so many layers attached to the IoT in terms of its connectivity, storage, functionality, system integration, extracting, and managing all the data exuded from these chatty systems becomes a major task.</p>\n<p>With artificial intelligence coming into play, accessing and simplifying data obtained from IoT networks is becoming easier. Merging AI with the IoT is not just transforming the way businesses process their information, their interaction with customers is also evolving. AI-powered systems help companies extract important data about their customers, employees, suppliers, partners, and more.</p>\n<p>The IoT serves as the binding mechanism for distributed systems, whereas AI manages all the devices and evaluates data to deliver better products and services to the consumer.

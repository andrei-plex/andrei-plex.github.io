However, the eCommerce sector can derive substantial benefits from the technology too, and undergo a remarkable transformation of its own.</p>\n<p>Check out this article to get more insights regarding the metaverse in eCommerce, discover what monetization opportunities it offers to retailers, and find out which brands have already hopped aboard the digital bandwagon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basics-of-the-metaverse\">Brushing up on the basics of the metaverse</h2>\n<p>When metaverse technology first appeared on the horizon, it took all of us by surprise and everyone was asking one and the same question: “What is the metaverse, really?”. Even if you are already well-versed in it, it is worth letting us briefly explain the fundamentals. Then we will move on to more interesting stuff (we promise).</p>\n<p>In simple terms, the metaverse is a graphically saturated virtual network representing interactive, real-time 3D spaces. The metaverse makes use of the most advanced technologies, including <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/services/blockchain-consulting/\">blockchain</a>, non-fungible tokens, social commerce, augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), and many others.</p>\n<p>The metaverse serves as a platform that allows us to play, work, study, shop, and hang out with others just like in real life. In particular, it zeroes in on the key idea of ‘presence’, meaning that users are supposed to feel as if they are really there in a given place, interacting with others.</p>\n<p>As the metaverse evolves, it is likely to engage many other technologies and principles that will contribute to its even more effective functioning and enable a greater number of people to savor new experiences.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Read this article to learn about all the ins and outs of the metaverse","url":"https://pixelplex.io/blog/what-is-metaverse/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<p>Before diving into the role of the metaverse in eCommerce, we recommend that you watch the video describing the most prominent metaverse cases.

It made previously conservative businesses go digital and offer their customers the opportunity to purchase their favorite products online without having to leave the sanctuary of their homes.</p>\n<p>As many retailers are thinking about moving their businesses online, it is expected that the number of users in the digital commerce domain will amount to around <a href=\"https://es.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-payments/digital-commerce/worldwide?currency=eur#users\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5,179 billion</a> by 2026 which by any standard looks quite staggering.</p>\n<h3>Overview of the key challenges and issues of eCommerce</h3>\n<p>Even so, the eCommerce industry still has to deal with a number of challenges and tackle a range of imperfections.

Below, we will take a closer look at how exactly the metaverse can shake up digital commerce.</p>\n<h3>The metaverse offers a personalized experience</h3>\n<p>Personalization in eCommerce is considered to be the cornerstone of success since it helps boost conversions and retain your customers. There are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/?sh=2ea55cb12a94\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multiple statistics</a> that demonstrate the importance of providing customers with a personalized approach and not treating them like numbers.</p>\n<p>The metaverse, for its part, enables brands to introduce their customers to cool and highly personalized digital experiences. By making use of AR and VR tools, shoppers can have a better sense of the desired product. They can examine its details in more depth, look at it from different angles, rotate and zoom it in, see user reviews, and get advice on how to use it.</p>\n<p>Emma Ridderstad, the CEO at Warpin, a Stockholm-based tech start-up that cooperates with brands such as H&amp;M and Disney, believes that the metaverse has the capacity to upend traditional shopping experiences in myriad ways.</p>\n<p>According to her,</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Within a digital world, consumers will be able to try on clothes virtually, giving customers greater scope for creativity and personal style, as they’ll no longer be limited by what’s in stock in a physical location”</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>The metaverse can help extend customer bases</h3>\n<p>Metaverse technology will enable customers to find exactly what they want and provide an immersive experience that will make the entire shopping routine more enjoyable and engaging.</p>\n<p>It will help shoppers to feel confident about the fit or quality of a product, as well as to have fun and make more informed purchasing decisions. As a result, shoppers are likely to continue using services from that merchant. Besides this, they will recommend the seller to their friends and family, and invite them to go virtual shopping together.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Take a look at this VR real estate platform for generating high-quality 360° virtual tours","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/vr-real-estate-platform-for-generating-360-virtual-tours/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>The metaverse can help eCommerce businesses boost ROI</h3>\n<p>According to one Google survey, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/ar-shopping-interest-statistics/#:~:text=66%25%20of%20people%20say%20they,AR%20Survey%2C%20Global%2C%202019.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">66% of people</a> are keen to use AR tools while shopping, which consequently results in higher satisfaction rates and makes customers willing to buy products that they can test in the 3D format.</p>\n<p>In the metaverse, customers will not only have greater powers of visualization but will also have a chance to communicate with shop assistants. Provided that your staff helps foster a metaverse store environment in which shoppers can embrace the full gamut of emotions, your customers are very likely to get interested in your products and buy them.</p>\n<p>What’s more, if you are among early adopters of the metaverse, your brand will become a household name and you can, later on, advise other businesses on incorporating the metaverse in their processes.</p>\n<h3>The metaverse provides a variety of gamification options</h3>\n<p>It was the gaming world that first embraced the metaverse. It has absorbed the best practices of the technology, so now gaming enthusiasts across the globe enjoy a wide range of experiences and opportunities in the metaverse space.</p>\n<p>Generally, metaverse games are reliant on the play-to-earn (P2E) concept that makes it possible for players to win gaming items and exchange them for real rewards. In addition, in metaverse games players can collaborate with other players in an organic environment, feeling just like they were interacting with one another in the real world.</p>\n<p>The important thing to note is that metaverse-powered gamification techniques can be successfully implemented in the eCommerce industry too.</p>\n<p>Fashion retailers, for example, have been enthusiastic about introducing metaverse games to their customers. In August 2021, <a href=\"https://thefashionmediagroup.com/technology/louis-vuitton-in-the-metaverse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Louis Vuitton</a> launched an adventure-based mobile game — Louis the Game — to celebrate its 200th anniversary and commemorate its founder. The game boasted tremendous metrics: it reached the half a million mark within a week!</p>\n<p>The LV game also possesses thirty NFTs, ten of which have been created by Beeple. Thanks to these inventive approaches, the brand has laid the foundation for its further metaverse expansion and managed to attract a new segment of young customers.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can come up with other metaverse-powered entertainment activities and games that consumers can engage with when buying groceries or clothes, earning themselves tokens or NFTs that can be exchanged for loyalty rewards. By merging metaverse gaming with your retail brand, you will contribute to more immersive experiences that will definitely please your customer base.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"short_link_block","title":"Check out the games that we have successfully developed for our clients","url":"https://pixelplex.io/work/gaming/","type_url":"inner"},{"acf_fc_layout":"textbox","text":"<h3>The metaverse leverages NFTs to roll over for both customers and brands</h3>\n<p>Once in the metaverse, brands can turn their attention to <a id=\"articleservice\" href=\"https://pixelplex.io/nft-development/\">non-fungible tokens</a> and use them for multiple purposes to help boost the shopping experience. The most prominent are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">receipts containing the information about the purchase</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">access to a brand’s events, star-studded concerts, or product launches conducted in the metaverse</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">special programs for a brand’s most dedicated customers and ambassadors</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">tickets to appointment shopping in the metaverse, where a brand’s representative will address the buyer’s questions about a product and provide recommendations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The metaverse allows brands to better understand customer behavior</h3>\n<p>Thanks to metaverse shopping, eCommerce business owners can better understand and analyze how their customers interact with and respond to their merchandising and marketing strategies.</p>\n<p>Doing so offline tends to be quite challenging and tiresome and even digital Commerce has some limitations.</p>\n<p>But by making use of virtual shopping assistants alongside AR and VR tools, all integrated into a single metaverse platform, brands can gain deeper insights into the performance of their offerings, assess customer behavior, and therefore provide more tailored recommendations.</p>\n<h3>Metaverse advertising can help your brand establish a global presence</h3>\n<p>If you are still not ready to go big with the metaverse and fully relocate your brand to the virtual space, you can consider advertising your services or products in the metaverse.</p>\n<p>This type of advertising is similar to traditional billboards but comes with more exciting options. You can rent a building or a plot of land in the metaverse and start promoting your brands there. Today there are many enthusiasts who have purchased virtual lands and real estate and leased them to other metaverse users for diverse purposes, with advertising and events organizations among them.</p>\n<p>In this way, you will manage to establish your digital presence and get more recognition.
